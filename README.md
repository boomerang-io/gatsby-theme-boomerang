  Gatsby Theme Boomerang
</h1>

The Gatsby Boomerang theme includes all the configuration you need to build a site with Boomerang and the [Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com).

Uses [Gatsby themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/themes/) functionality

## Getting started

1. Install `yarn` if you don't have it
2. `yarn install` at the root of the project (not for each package)
3. `yarn dev` to start the example app
4. Make changes to the example sample content docs or the theme to see changes

## Commands

### yarn dev

Start the example app that uses the `gatsby-theme-boomerang`

### yarn build

Build the example app that uses the `gatsby-theme-boomerang`

### yarn lint:js

Lint all of the `.js` files

### yarn format

Format all of the `css,scss,json,html,yaml,mdx` files

### yarn release

Use `lerna` to release `gatsby-theme-boomerang`


## Project Structure

Yarn and Lerna managed monorepo. There are two packages - `gatsby-theme-boomerang` and `example`. The former is the theme itself and the latter is a Gatsby application that uses the theme.
