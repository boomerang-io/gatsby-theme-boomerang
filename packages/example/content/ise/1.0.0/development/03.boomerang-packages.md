# Boomerang Packages

We have several npm packages that assist the development of Boomerang webapps. The source code can be found in our OSS [boomerang-io](https://github.com/boomerang-io) GitHub organization. They are published to npm under the `@boomerang-io` scope.

## Prerequisites

Complete the [Frontend Onboarding](frontend-onboarding).

## Carbon Addons Boomerang React

[Carbon Addons Boomerang React](https://github.com/boomerang-io/carbon-addons-boomerang-react) is a library of React components built using [Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/).

- Uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for development and consumption
- [Carbon Addons Boomerang React Storybook](https://carbon-addons-boomerang-react.netlify.app/)
- Adds additional components not included in Carbon
- Includes custom wrapper components around Carbon's React components, as well as exporting all of the React Carbon components
- Published to @boomerang-io scope and hosted on the Boomerang platform Artifactory instance

**Deprecated**

- We have moved everything to the open source and restarted the versioning. The original, closed-source package `@boomerang/carbon-addons-boomerang-react` and [repo](https://github.ibm.com/Boomerang-Lib/boomerang.package.carbon-addons-boomerang-react) are still available.
- Formerly the styles for these components existed in their [own repo](https://github.ibm.com/Boomerang-Lib/boomerang.package.carbon-addons-boomerang), but as of the `3.0.0` release, we have made the decision to co-locate the styles within the Boomerang Carbon Add-ons React repository. The styles repository will remain in existence as teams continue to migrate to the latest version of our library, but future updates to styles will be made in our React repository.

### Using

You will need either [npm](https://github.com/npm/npm) or [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn). Either command below will work.

```sh
yarn add @boomerang-io/carbon-addons-boomerang-react
```

```sh
npm install @boomerang-io/carbon-addons-boomerang-react
```

```js
import { Error404 } from "@boomerang-io/carbon-addons-boomerang-react";

<Error404 header={"Welp"} title="Nothing to see here" message="Sorry, we can't find what you are looking for." />;
```

### Local Development

Often times we want to add, extened or fix a component as it is being used in another application. An easy way to avoid the "change, publish, use" cycle is link the local Boomerang Components repository to your project. Any local changes to the component library will be immediately available to the local project. This speeds up development time and prevents the need to publish several versions of the library to test changes. You can perform a link with both yarn and npm.

- [yarn link](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/link/)
- [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link)

### Importing Styles

Users are able to export styles from the react repository. Example import statement from an scss file:

```js
@import "~@boomerang-io/carbon-addons-boomerang-react/styles/scss/styles";
```

### Publishing

If you want to publish updates to the package, you need to follow the steps for [Frontend Developer Onboarding](frontend-developer-onboarding) documentation. After you have write access, you can publish like any other npm package.

## Boomerang Webapp Server

[Webapp SPA Server](https://github.com/boomerang-io/webapp-packages/tree/main/packages/webapp-spa-server) provides a consistent way to deploy Boomerang React SPAs with client-side routing into an IBM Cloud Private environment.

### Features

- Serve static assets
- Client-side routing
- Dynamic data and script injection into HTML document at run-time
- Logging with [@boomerang-io/logger-middleware](https://github.com/boomerang-io/webapp-packages/tree/main/packages/logger-middleware)
- Cloud native health checking with [Cloud Native Health Connect](@cloudnative/health-connect)
- New Relic monitoring

### Design

The webapp server can be invoked via a command line or imported as a configurable function to be executed.

- CLI
- Function

### CLI

The server can be invoked easily via a CLI command. Configuration can be entered as options.

Enter the following to see the manual

```sh
boomerang-webapp-server --help
```

## Boomerang Utilities

[Boomerang Utilities](https://github.com/boomerang-io/webapp-packages/tree/main/packages/utils) is a library of reusable React utilities built for the Boomerang platform.

### Install

You will need either [npm](https://github.com/npm/npm) or [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn). Either command below will work.

```

## Boomerang Create React App [deprecated]

See [Boomerang Create React App](boomerang-create-react-app).

## Boomerang JSON Server [deprecated]

> Note: This package is deprecated and no longer actively maintained. It is recommended to use another package for a local mock API server such as [miragejs](https://miragejs.com/) or [msw](https://mswjs.io/). The default [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) is still an option as well.

[Boomerang JSON Server](https://github.ibm.com/Boomerang-Lib/boomerang.package.json-server) is an extension of [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) with support for afterwares. This makes it much more powerful as we you are able to change the request and the response, not only the request. It is useful for modifying data that comes back from db.json. Updated documentation is here. Please navigate to the original project for the rest of the documentation.

### Add afterwares

You can add your afterwares (which modifies the response) from the CLI using `--afterwares` option:

```js
// bye.js
module.exports = (res) => {
  res.locals.forEach((x) => (x.modified = true));
};
```

```sh
json-server db.json --afterwares ./hello.js
```

### CLI usage

```sh
json-server [options] <source>

Options:
--middlewares, -m  Paths to middleware files                           [array]
```

## Boomerang Components [deprecated]

> Note:  This package is deprecated and no longer actively maintained. Deprecated in favor of the Carbon Components React and Carbon Addons Boomerang React component libraries

[Boomerang Components](https://github.ibm.com/Boomerang-Lib/boomerang.package.components) is a library of reusable React components built for the Boomerang platform.

- Uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for development and consumption
- Includes fully-custom components and customized wrappers around popular React components
- Published to @boomerang scope and hosted on the Boomerang platform Artifactory instance

### Using

You will need either [npm](https://github.com/npm/npm) or [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn). Either command below will work.

```sh
yarn add @boomerang/boomerang-components
```

```sh
npm install @boomerang/boomerang-components
```

```js
import LoadingAnimation from "@boomerang/boomerang-components/lib/LoadingAnimation";

<LoadingAnimation />;
```

### Local Development

Often times we want to add, extened or fix a component as it is being used in another application. An easy way to avoid the "change, publish, use" cycle is link the local Boomerang Components repository to your project.
