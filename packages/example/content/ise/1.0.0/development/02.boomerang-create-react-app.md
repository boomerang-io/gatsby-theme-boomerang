# Boomerang Create React App [deprecated]

> Note: Boomerang Create React App is no longer under active development. We recommend using Create React App with our [open source Boomerang template](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@boomerang-io/cra-template-boomerang) to get started quickly with building cloud-native React SPA web apps. There are also Framework alternatives to consider like Next.js and Gatsby.js, but we don't provide a template for them.

Boomerang Create React App (BCRA) is a fork of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (CRA) with additional configuration and starter template for creating React applications quickly and consistently. It has all of the benefits of the latest starter kit from Facebook with additional features without ejecting. Please reference the CRA project for additional information about using this starter kit beyond what is covered in this document.

The repo can be found on [GitHub Enterprise](https://github.ibm.com/Boomerang/boomerang.app.create-react-app).

## Enhancements

1. [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) and [React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) included and configured.
2. `cra-template-boomerang`template with opioninated folder structure, default configuration and example code for quick start development and deployment.
3. [Boomerang Webapp Server](boomerang-packages) for cloud-native deployments via assets path rewriting, client-side routing and dynamic data and script injection.
4. Improved testing with [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme), [react-testing-library]([@testing-library), [Cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress)and bundle size analysis with [Source Map Explorer](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer).
5. Boomerang CICD and Docker configuration.
6. Improved Hot Module Reloading for `JavaScript` files with [React Fast Refresh](https://mariosfakiolas.com/blog/what-the-heck-is-react-fast-refresh/).
7. Code quality and formatting control via [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) and .git commit hooks.
8. Included default dependencies for out-of-the-box functionality for network requests, classNames, aysnc redux, routing.
9. API server via [JSON-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) for local development and testing.
10. Proxy server configuration for [port forwarding](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/) to Boomerang platform for easier development and debugging.
11. Webpack aliases to project top-level directories for clean imports.
12. WebWorker support via [Worker-Loder](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/worker-loader).
13. Additional scripts for simulating production deployment, Docker deployment, and upgrading dependencies, tooling config, code coverage, and port forwarding.

## Prerequisites

## Create Project with Boomerang Create React App

Run create-react-app command with custom react-scripts flag. This will create a new directory with your React project in it. You will see `boomerang-react-scripts` as a dependency in the `package.json`, along with several defaults.

```shell
npx create-react-app <my-project> --scripts-version @boomerang/boomerang-react-scripts --template "@boomerang/cra-template-boomerang"

## Added Scripts

Projects boostrapped with BCRA will include the default CRA scripts and notably the following scripts:

- `analyze` - analyze and debug application's bundle using [source-map-explorer](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer).
- `apiServer` - start API server for local testing using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
- `cm` - commit code using [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) CLI helper.
- `cypress` - start the testing framework [cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress).
- `cypress:run` - run the testing framework [cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) without recording video. Used in CI environment.
- `dev` - start the application and apiServer.
- `dev:pf` - start the application, apiServer and port forwarding.
- `lint` - run ESLint against all files in the `src` directory.
- `docker` - production build, build and run Docker container with [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
- `prod` - production build and start app server locally with [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
- `test` - modified default CRA script to determine whether to test as if running locally or in a CI system.
- `test:ci` - run Jest and exit when done. Writes test and coverage results to file for Boomerang CICD consumption.
- `test:ci-cypress` - start development app and server then run cypress tests. Useful in CI environment.
- `test:coverage` - generate code coverage report for local consumption.
- `test:staged` - run tests for files associated changes and exit. Used in pre-commit hook.
- `test:static` - run eslint static code analysis and generate report
- `test:watch` - run Jest in watch mode. Ran in local development by default with `npm test`.
- `upgradePackage` - update application package's dependencies and scripts to match template.

## Upgrading from < v2.2.0

Version `^2.2.0` includes the react-script `upgradePackage` to makes keeping project npm scripts, dependencies and tooling configuration in your `package.json` consistent across projects and up to date simple. Upgrading to the newest version however will **not** include the npm script in your project's `package.json` or update your dependencies. Thankfully with versions of `npm@^5.2.0`, the `npx` binary executor is installed by default along with npm. To upgrade your project you need to run the following command:

```shell
npm install @boomerang/boomerang-react-scripts@latest
npx react-scripts upgradePackage
```

The script starts an interactive CLI that will prompt you to confirm changes or additions to your npm scripts, dependencies and tooling configuration. The changes are opt-out for convenience so review the changes that are being applied if you have made any custom changes that you don't want to be overwritten.

You should see the npm script `upgradePackage` added to your `package.json` added along with new or upgraded dependencies. Now keeping things up to date with the latest _app_ configuration changes can be done with `npm run-script upgradePackage`.

## Webpack Aliases

[Webpack aliases](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvealias) make import statements easier to perform and components more portable. They provide a shortcut to specific directories in the `src` of the application. The following aliases are included:

- assets
- components
- config
- constants
- features
- hooks
- state
- styles
- utilities
- utils

For imports in `.js` files, you can use `from "~Directory"` or `from "Directory"` syntax. Either one works.

```diff
- import { SOME_CONSTANT } from "../../../constants/myConstants";
+ import { SOME_CONSTANT } from "Constants/myConstants";
+ import { SOME_CONSTANT } from "~Constants/myConstants";
```

For imports in `.scss` files, you must prefix the import with a `~` for Webpack to resolve imports to both our root `styles` directory **AND** to `node_modules`. See [Sass-Loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader#imports) for more information about this.

```diff
- @import "../../../path/to/styles/colors";
+ @import "~Styles/colors"
```

## Testing Config

Additional testing configuration is included by via the `src/setupTests.js` file to simplify unit testing with Jest, Enzyme, React Testing Library and Cypresss. It adds:

- Enzyme adapter for React 16 compatibility
- Enzyme and React Testing Library functions globally available
- Global render wrappers for React Router and Redux for React Testing Library to reduce testing boilerplate
- Mocked browser storage for `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`
- Fixed UTC date and timezone including config for `moment.js` (useful for snapshots with timestamps)

## Build and Deploy to Kubernetes

We have structured the applications to support cloud native deployment.

- Update app configuration if it is not served on the root context of the host

  - View `"homepage"` property in `package.json`. By default it is set to the following:

  ```json
  "homepage": "https://launch.boomerangplatform.net/BMRG_APP_ROOT_CONTEXT"
  ```

  - Update respective .env files

  ```shell
  APP_ROOT=/myApp
  ```

- Use dynamic data injected into `<head />` of html file.

  - The environment variables such as `APP_ROOT` must be injected into the container by Kubernetes. Speak to a DevOps team member about any environment variables you need injected into your application.
  - Update web application to read in the global variables added to the `window._SERVER_DATA` object.

  ```js
  // webapp .js file
  const APP_DYNAMIC_CONSTANT = window._SERVER_DATA.APP_DYNAMIC_CONSTANT;
  ```

- Add additional js files to `public` directory and update `HTML_HEAD_INJECTED_SCRIPTS` environment property in corresponding `.env` file - e.g. New Relic analytics

  - You can add multiple files via this property. It accepts a comma separated list of file names. The Boomerang WebApp server will build up the string file to be injected into the `<head />` of the html file automatically.

  ```JavaScript
  HTML_HEAD_INJECTED_SCRIPTS=newrelic.stage.js,script1.js,script2.js
  ```

## Testing production builds locally

You can test production builds locally to ensure the dynamic data is being injected, the right service endpoints are being called, and the correct scripts are being linked in the index.html file.

Run production build locally. It compiles the application and runs the Express server.

`npm run prod`

Run production build locally in a Docker container (requires user to have Docker installed and running locally).

`npm run docker`

## Debugging with deployed services

`json-server` makes local development and testing possible independent of services as mock REST api. However, developing complicated service flows or debugging issues be difficult if your services can't be perfectly represented as a collection of resources. [Port forwarding](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/) to deployed services can make your life much easier in certain situations. View the following files to see how port forwarding is enabled:

- `src/setupPortForwarding`
- `src/setupProxy`
- `src/config/servicesConfig`

Read more about how port forwarding works with [CRA API proxying](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/).
