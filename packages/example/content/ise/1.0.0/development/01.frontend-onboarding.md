## Frontend Onboarding

Welcome to the Boomerang platform. Glad you are here! Please follow the steps below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have the following tools installed.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v10 or greater
  - If you're on macOS, we recommend using
    [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to help manage different versions of
    Node.js [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md) as your
    version manager for Node.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v5.2 or greater
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub Enterprise](https://github.ibm.com)
- Access to IBM network
- IDE/Text Editor
  - We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for Frontend development
 
 
## OSS Boomerang Packages

We have open source packages that are used by our web apps. They are hosted on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) under the [boomerang.io organization](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/boomerang-io/packages). All packages are scoped to `@boomerang-io`. As a frontend developer, you will be added as a member to the organization.  

## Private Boomerang Packages

We have private packages that may be used by legacy applications or other apps on the platform. These packages are scoped to `@boomerang`. To consume these packages, your npm client needs to be configured to use the platform Artifactory instance where they are hosted . Run the following to configure your local to allow you to both *read* and *write* (publish) the private packages. If you only want to *consume* packages skip to the following section. 

1. Execute the following curl command to retrieve a complete `.npmrc` file that configures your npm client. See [npmrc documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/configuring-npm/npmrc.html) for more information. 

```shell
$ curl -u <YOUR_EMAIL>:<API_KEY> https://tools.boomerangplatform.net/artifactory/api/npm/boomeranglib-npm/auth/boomerang -o ~/.npmrc
```

2. Your `~/.npmrc` file should look like the following:

```shell
@boomerang:registry=https://tools.boomerangplatform.net/artifactory/api/npm/boomeranglib-npm/
//tools.boomerangplatform.net/artifactory/api/npm/boomeranglib-npm/:_password=<BASE64_API_KEY>
//tools.boomerangplatform.net/artifactory/api/npm/boomeranglib-npm/:username=<YOUR_EMAIL>
//tools.boomerangplatform.net/artifactory/api/npm/boomeranglib-npm/:email=<YOUR_EMAIL>
//tools.boomerangplatform.net/artifactory/api/npm/boomeranglib-npm/:always-auth=true
```

3. Run `npm install @boomerang/<boomerang-package>` or `yarn install @boomerang/<boomerang-package>` to verify that it worked e.g. `npm install @boomerang/boomerang-utilities`.

### Consume Only

If you only want to consume `@boomerang` packages, it is much simpler. Run the following command

```sh
npm config set @boomerang:registry https://tools.boomerangplatform.net/artifactory/api/npm/boomeranglib-npm/
```
