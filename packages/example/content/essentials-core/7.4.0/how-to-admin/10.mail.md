# Mail

Boomerang Admin provides functionality to view, edit and create Mail templates. These templates provide the mapping between a Mail event and a SendGrid<sup>Â®</sup> template and define the required SendGrid metadata, Mail event type, and dynamic inputs that are required.

> Note: The platform comes with a number of templates that are required if Mail is enabled. The dependent SendGrid templates must be in your SendGrid account.
