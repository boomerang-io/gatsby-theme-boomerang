# Status

Platform status allows users to perform a number of platform status management tasks for:

## Key terms

**Component**  
Represents any part of the platform that is being monitored, including infrastructure and Catalog services.

**Event**  
Anything that happens to the platform that affects its availability or stability. Events include both `incidents` and `maintenances`.

**Incident**
Any form of an outage or disruption of service for a component that is unplanned. There are two types: Partial Outage and Outage that represent severity.

**Maintenance**  
Scheduled outages for servicing, upgrading or replacing Status components.

## Statuses

Status text, icon and color are used to communicate the status of the platform overall, a category of components and an individual component.
