# Installing

Essentials Core has two methods of installation: manual with Helm <sup>®</sup>, and the Boomerang CLI. Using the CLI, You can get a running Core installation in under **10 minutes**!

See the following sections to determine the right installation method for you. Ensure you have read information on all the [prerequisites](/essentials-core/installing/pre-requisites), especially related to the chosen Kubernetes<sup>®</sup> service.

## Using the Boomerang CLI

The Boomerang CLI allows you to interactively, or quietly, install Essentials Core, along with dependencies such as Tiller, NGINX Ingress Controller, MongoDB<sup>®</sup>, and Boomerang Auth Proxy. By default, the installer runs interactively unless `-q` is passed to run in quiet mode.

The other key aspect when running the installer is that it can save the inputed state in a `config.state` file. It will also attempt to read from this file if present.

Prior to any install running, you need to ensure you have logged into your Kubernetes cluster. See [Kube Config and Cluster Authentication](/essentials-core/installing/pre-requisites#kube-config-and-cluster-authentication) prerequisites.

### Running the install command

The following command will run an interactive install, mount the Kubernetes configuration into the container, and use the hosts network.

The interactive install will guide you with a series of prompts on the command line to confirm the defaults or adjust the configuration for a successful end to end install.

> **Note**: Because Amazon EKS uses IAM to provide authentication to the Kubernetes cluster, `-v $HOME/.aws:/root/.aws` mount option should be added to the `docker run` command everytime the CLI is executed against this platform.

```
docker run -it --rm --network=host -v "$HOME/.kube/config:/cli/kubeconfig" tools.boomerangplatform.net:8500/public/ise/bmrg-util-cli:1.4.1 install
```

#### Quiet install

To run in quiet mode, you can run any variation of the commands with `-q` being passed into the command. When running in quiet mode, it will default to the `config.state` file, and if you do not pass a state file, it will default to the values in the `config.yaml`, which may result in a incomplete installation. We _recommend_ to always pass in a state file when running in quiet mode.

```
docker run -it --rm --network=host -v "$HOME/.kube/config:/cli/kubeconfig" -v "$PWD/config.state:/cli/config.state" tools.boomerangplatform.net:8500/public/ise/bmrg-util-cli:1.4.1 install -q
```

The configuration state will be noted on the command line, however, no prompts will be made.

### Retrieving an initial state file

Run the following command to get a `config.state` file, this can be useful if you want to compare against a saved state or if you want to be able to save the state from an interactive run.

If you already have a saved `config.state` file from a previous run, you can skip this step.

> **Note**: This will overwrite any existing config.state file at this location.

```
docker run -it --rm --entrypoint=cat tools.boomerangplatform.net:8500/public/ise/bmrg-util-cli:1.4.1 config.yaml > config.state
```

You can also manually configure the state in the file, prior to running a quiet install. This can be highly useful if running in an automated or repeatable fashion.

### Saving the state when installing

If you want to save the state for future use or load a previous state to default the prompts, run the following adjusted command.

As you can see, we have mounted the `config.state` into the container. This file needs to exist or the command will fail. See *Retrieving an initial state file* in the previous instruction. 

```
docker run -it --rm --network=host -v "$HOME/.kube/config:/cli/kubeconfig" -v "$PWD/config.state:/cli/config.state" tools.boomerangplatform.net:8500/public/ise/bmrg-util-cli:1.4.1 install
```

### Advanced installs

The CLI allows for a number of advanced use cases, including bring your own Helm chart values files. In this case, you can additionally mount these YAML files into the container. This can be useful if you are running this for a cluster install and want to alter the versions of make advanced configuration changes.

1. Adjust the installer's configuration parameters, as needed, by opening up the `config.state` files.

2. Have values files locally, named as mentioned in the table, for the Helm charts you wish to customize.

3. Run the previous install commands, having mounted each particular file as needed.

## Manual Helm chart

The manual installation method only installs Essentials Core using a Helm v3 compatible chart. All dependencies need to be installed as part of the [prerequisites](/essentials-core/installing/pre-requisites)

1. Inspect the `README.md` and create your `values.yaml` for your particular environment, using the following commands and updating the default `values.yaml`

```
helm inspect readme boomerang-charts/bmrg-core --version <version>
helm inspect values boomerang-charts/bmrg-core --version <version> > values.yaml
```

2. Adjust the `image.registry` value in the `values.yaml` to allow anonymous access to the published docker containers.

```yaml
image:
  registry: tools.boomerangplatform.net:8500/public/ise
```

3. Run the `helm install` or `helm upgrade --install` command. We _recommend_ passing in the `--version` flag to ensure you are installing the correct version.

```
helm upgrade --debug --install --namespace <namespace> -f values.yaml <release_name> boomerang-charts/bmrg-core --version <version>
```

4. The Helm chart will output the URLs and meta info for the installation and the one-time activation token needed for the First Time Activation wizard.

```
NOTES:
** Activation **
To complete the one-time setup and activation of Core, you need to retrieve the one-time code and enter into the platform.

1. Retrieve the code by running:

  kubectl get secret --namespace <namespace> bmrg-core-secrets -o jsonpath="{.data.CORE_OTC}" | base64 --decode

2. Navigate to Launchpad (link provided in Access below).
```

## Post install

### First Time Activation wizard

The First Time Activation wizard will appear, and redirection will occur, until the one-time activation token is provided.

This is an important step to ensure that an administrator account is dynamically created, providing the user the correct entitlements to perform the post install configuration steps.

The token is provided at the end of the installation.

### Post install configuration

Post installation and activation, you will be able to navigate to Admin Settings and configure the settings of the platform.

As per the [Boomerang Configuration Architecture](/boomerang/7.3.0/architecture/configuration-architecture), there is configuration that can be done post install to try and alleviate the number of values provided at install time.

There is nothing worse than having to put together a values YAML with greater than 100 values!
