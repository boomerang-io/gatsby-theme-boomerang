# Management APIs

Access to the API endpoints is governed by a feature flag during installation of the platform.

To use these APIs, you must also have an authorization token in the header of the request. To obtain the access token, core platform admins can create one via the following steps:

1. Navigate to Admin > Service Tokens.
2. Click **Create Token** (top right corner).
3. Select the scope of the platform or service depending on API being used.

4. (optionally) Select an expiry date for the token.

This will generate a unique token for you to access Core Platform Management APIs.
