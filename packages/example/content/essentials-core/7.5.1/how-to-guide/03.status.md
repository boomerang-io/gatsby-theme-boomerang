# Checking status

This feature allows you to see status of the entire IBM Services Essentials platform, check services status and view information about incidents and maintenances.

Select an item at the Filter by event type to restrict the display to the status for any of the following types: **Maintenance**, **Outage**, **Partial outage**, or **All types**.

The number of events in each type is indicated by a count indicator on each tab.
