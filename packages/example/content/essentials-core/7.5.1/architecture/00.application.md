**Dependencies**

The following platform-wide dependencies are prior to, and in addition to, any dependencies for the additional components, such as Core.

## Core

Core is the centralized enabler and common services for a platform. It provides an architecture and application functionality to create an interoperable set of services that can be brought together to create applications.

This creates a collection of technology capabilities and components that enable you to build upon it. The Core exposes upward services for applications to run, that enable the rapid development of those applications. This ensures a common consistent approach, methodology, and implementation. The Core provides a holistic joint experience, opposed to disparate custom microservices.

Core allows applications to be designed and constructed agnostic to the underlying infrastructure or security protocols.

### Features

The following are the functional features provided by the platform and are supported by a user experience, and frameworks. 

- Authentication
- Authorization (role-based access control, RBAC)
- Audit
- Requests
- Catalog (service discovery and provisioning)
- Logging
- Settings
- Status management
- Notifications
- Messaging (Mail and Slack<sup>®</sup>)
- Support (Support Center, Raise a Bug, Contact Us)
- Docs
- API Docs
- Content

#### Optional features

The following subset of features can be optionally enabled or disabled via feature flags at installation time with further integration information provide post install via the platforms settings. These features are disabled as part of Core Lite.

- Notifications
- Messaging (Mail and Slack)
- Support (Support Center, Raise a Bug, Contact Us)
- Docs
- API Docs
- Metering

#### Optional operational integrations

The following optional operational integrations can be enabled at installation with the Helm<sup>®</sup> chart.

- Tracing with Jaeger
- Monitoring with New Relic
- Wordpress<sup>®</sup> Integration

### Resource requirements

The minimum resource specification requirements for running these components in non-HA, and not including middleware. This is the minimum starting requirement, not the running requirement based on usage patterns. The memory and CPU will increase with usage.

| Implementation | CPU    | Memory | Disk           |
| -------------- | ------ | ------ | -------------- |
| Core           | 1 vCPU | 2.2 GB | No Persistence |
| Core Lite      | 1 vCPU | 1.6GB  | No Persistence |
