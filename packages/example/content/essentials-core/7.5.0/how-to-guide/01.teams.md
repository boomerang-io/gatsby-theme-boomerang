# Working with teams

Teams are accessed from the Essentials Home page. All currently active teams are displayed in the left pane. 

Both private and public teams are displayed. A team can be made public or private by the Team Owner in team settings. Refer to 

### Public teams

All teams who are configured with a **Public** setting is viewable in the Teams pane. User who want to join a public team can use the **Join/create team** feature.

### Private teams

Private teams appear in the side panel, along with Public teams. Private teams are differentiated with a lock icon displayed alongside the Public team name. 

Private teams aren't discoverable by non-team members. They don't appear in the search results for Join a team, and users who want to join need to be invited by a Team Owner or platform Administrator. 

### Private Instance teams

If you access a private instance of the platform, all teams that appear on the left panel are Private teams. You won't be able to join any of the teams that are on the platform unless a Team Owner or a platform Administrator adds you to that team. You can also join a Private team via a shared link.

Likewise, all teams created on a private instance of the platform will be Private teams.

# Team Functionality

> **Note:** Team Owners control who joins their team, and they also make requests for services to be added to their teams. The Team Owner role allows an elevated type of user to manage the members and services of their teams. Refer to [Administering Teams](/essentials-core/how-to-admin/teams).

## Create a team

1. From the Essentials Home page, click `Join / create a team`. If you are not on the Home page, click **Launchpad** and make sure **Home** is selected.

3. Click `Create`. The team appears along with the existing teams in the left navigation panel.

>**Note**: There is an admin platform-wide setting for automatic team creation. If that is enabled, then your team would be automatically created upon submitting the form. Otherwise, your form submission will generate a team creation request that will have to be approved by an administrator.

>**Note**: If you have not previously consented to the platform, you will be promoted to do so.

## Services

This functionality allows you to view and search all of the services added to a team. You can request to add new services to a team via Catalog. Services that have a pending **Join a Service** are also shown with information about the request.

> Only Team Owners can request to add a service to a team in Catalog.

![Team Services](./assets/img/teams/teamServices.png)

#### Add a service

Use **Catalog** to request to add additional services to a team. You can follow the **Check out Catalog** link or navigate to **Catalog** in the top navigation bar. See the [Catalog How-To](/essentials-core/how-to-guide/catalog/) for more information.

When you add a Catalog service to your team, a Create a Service request is created. When approved, a corresponding Join a Service request is created for the service for each user in the team. Users gain access to the service after their request has been approved. Users can see all pending service requests in the **Service Requests** tab.

> **Note**: If you change your mind or make a mistake, Team Owners can create a Removal request to remove a Catalog service from their team.

## Members

### View team members

All members of a team are searchable by name and email. Team Owners can manage members roles, update their permissions, and request to remove them from the team.

> **Note**: Teams must have at least one Team Owner. If there is currently only one owner, that owner cannot be a regular user. To change the Team Owner, you must make another team member a Team Owner first.

<!-- ![Members List](./assets/img/teams/boomerangadmin_teamsdetails_memberslist.png) -->

## Member requests

Click **Member Requests** in the header to view and process all of join requests for this team. Users can quickly approve or deny requests without need to navigate to the Requests feature.

#### Approving join requests

1. At this point, the request needs to be approved. Under the **Settings** tab, there is a configuration where join team requests can be enabled to be auto-approved (we recommend disabling this feature in shared instances). If **Auto-approval new team members** is enabled, then those individuals will be added to your team. If it is not enabled, then we will have two join team requests in the **Team Requests** tab.

2. Select **Approve** for each of the pending requests in order to add them to your team.

    Team Owners can also manage the roles that a member has for each of their team services. A team member can also remove a member of their team (although they cannot remove themselves).
