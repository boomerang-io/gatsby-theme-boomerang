# Navigating IBM Services Essentials

The IBM Services Essentials platform leverages an intuitive user interface based upon the centralized seamless user interface coupled with the frameworks provided by IBM Services Essentials Core.

This allows for a highly extensible and customizable implementation and encourages the services and assets provided on the platform to leverage the common services.

IBM Services Essentials Core defines how your team works within your solution. It is where you define your team and its members, member roles and the services available to your team. Refer to the [Overview](/essentials-core/introduction/overview) for more information.

![Platform Components](./assets/img/navigating-platform.png)

### Boomerang CICD

Boomerang CICD is where you define the Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment process. In this application you configure and orchestrate the movement of components through a pipeline, along with the triggers and gates that control their execution.

The pipelines in CICD support a variety of build tools and frameworks that will be used in the development, QA, and Deploy process. Each stage of the pipeline is configured on the Pipelines page. Refer to the [Boomerang CICD Overview](/boomerang-cicd/introduction/overview) to learn more.

### Boomerang Flow

Boomerang Flow is a standalone open-source application that allows you to enhance your solution with event driven workflows.

Refer to the [Boomerang Flow introduction](/boomerang-flow/introduction/overview) to learn more.
