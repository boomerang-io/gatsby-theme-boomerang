# Framework Architecture

The following defines the platform framework architecture and capabilities that are provided. The architecture is defined using a combination of standards, OSS, IBM, and other proprietary middleware products.

**Notes:**

1. With all the frameworks, we continue to evaluate future technologies (open source and proprietary).
2. Alpha frameworks are in development and only used by the Core component of the platform. Beta frameworks can be considered by some teams, however, the API or implementation may change.

## Auth

Provides authentication integration with client enterprise authentication providers and role based access controls (RBAC). Currently supports OpenID<sup>®</sup> Connect. See the Security Architecture topic for further information.

The Auth library is split into two key frameworks:

- Authentication (open source)
- Authorization (custom & middleware)

### Authentication

The authentication component is based on the open source OAuth2 Proxy. This is the industry default with Kubernetes<sup>®</sup> and NGINX, and is mentioned in numerous articles and reference material. Previously maintained by Bitly<sup>®</sup>, OAuth2 Proxy is now maintained by Pusher<sup>®</sup>. Our approach is the same as the OpenShift<sup>®</sup> approach that forked from Bitly.
It provides authentication using different identity providers. It also provides logout functionality by removing the cookie that was initially setup.

| Open Source Owner    | Pusher                                    |
| Open Source Version  | 4.0.0                                     |
| Platform Owner       | Tyson Lawrie, Costel Moraru               |
| Platform Version     | 4.0.0 (forked from 4.0.0 in October 2019) |
| Languages            | Go                                        |
| Dependent Middleware | NGINX                                     |
| Implementation       | Installed as a Middleware pod             |

**Libs**

- https://github.com/boomerang-io/oauth2-proxy

**What's next**

- SAML and basic authentication protocol support
- The testing of additional provider integrations for delivery projects
- Timeout refresh functionality

**Considerations**

1. Go skills are a requirement for the team to stay current with the project and to bring in monthly updates and test the changes.
2. The currently supported and validated integrations are: IBMID, W3ID, GitHub<sup>®</sup>, Azure<sup>®</sup>, and Boomerang Service Token. Basic authorization is in progress. Additional open source integrations such as Facebook<sup>®</sup> and Google are available, but have not been validated and are not currently supported.

### Authorization

The authorization component uses a custom framework written in Node.js and Java to integrate to the platforms backend microservices, backed by MongoDB and LDAP. Authorization provides the user's name, email and team roles to support RBAC.

- [boomerang.python.security](https://github.ibm.com/essentials-core/core.framework.security.python)

**Considerations**

- Supported version of the language or framework

## Audit

Provides audit controls and audit logging for applications and services. This data is then available in the Boomerang Admin Audit Log page, that provides the following functionality. For more detail see the documentation on Boomerang administration.

- Filter by Application, User, and Type (HTTP, CRUD, Custom)
- Filter by Date and Time range
- Display a Summary of Action taken by the user, including time of action
- Detail the action taken. If Type is HTTP, the audit will display the call. If Type is CRUD, the audit will show the Create, Read, Update, or Delete and compare the change.

| Summary              |                          |

**Libs**

- [boomerang.spring.audit](https://github.ibm.com/essentials-core/core.framework.audit.spring)
- [boomerang.nodejs.audit](https://github.ibm.com/essentials-core/core.framework.audit.nodejs)
- [boomerang.python.audit](https://github.ibm.com/essentials-core/core.framework.audit.python)

**Considerations**

The cloud native landscape is continually changing. We made an architectural decision to implement a custom audit log based on industry design principles for storing, such event driven data. Over time, this may involve to include an open source or proprietary product.

## Proxy

Provides REST APIs for automatic forwarding of requests from services running in private VLANs to external targets. This is a very simple, but important, library. A majority of the services running in ICP and Kubernetes in the customer's private data centers will not have direct access to the internet.

We use an open source Java library and dependency injection to determine the network level call implementation at runtime.

| Summary              |                      |
| :------------------- | :------------------- |

| Dependent Middleware | N/A                  |
| Implementation       | Library and Standard |

**What's next**

N/A

**Considerations**

An alternative implementation is to do the egress routing through another mechanism such as a service mesh (for example, Istio Egress Gateway)

## Logging

Standardized logging configurations and open source libraries for each development language are combined with the default ICP log collector of Elasticsearch<sup>®</sup>. Currently, logs are only kept for 24 hours.

**What's next**

- Python<sup>®</sup>
- Elasticsearch 6.x
- Increase in log collection length

**Considerations**

To view logs, a user requires access on the running Kubernetes platform.

## Tracing

Distributed tracing is used to profile and monitor applications on the platform that are built using a microservices architecture. Distributed tracing helps pinpoint where failures occur and what causes poor performance.

This framework is a standard, rather than an implementable framework. We have best practices and standards for integrating in your service and Helm<sup>®</sup> chart for the environment specific parameters. The code level framework is actually available as open sources projects that can be used here to submit distributed traces to the Jaeger instance running on the platform.

## Settings

A framework provides pulling in settings from the post-install configuration and settings structure in the platform. We use standard open source libraries and design for pulling in configuration at runtime, wrapped with a custom library to read from our MongoDB.

**Considerations**

Same considerations as the UI Shell.

## Eventing

Eventing is a way of handling the declaration (publishing) of an event and the consumption of the event, and allows for loosley-coupled distributed producers and consumers.

As of now, this is in alpha stage and only implemented for the Mail service. There is no event broker (NATS) implemented in Core, only an endpoint structured with CloudEvents payload structure.

| Platform Version     | alpha                                  |
| Languages            | Go, Java, JavaScript, C#, Ruby, and Python |
| Dependent Middleware | n/a |
| Implementation       | Library                             |

**What's next**

- Roll out to a mail framework that wraps the CloudEvent SDK with the mail-specific event payload
- Implementation of a broker middleware _if needed for scalability_

**Considerations**

[CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/) is an in-progress specification for describing event data in a common way and is under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

## Metering

A framework that facilitates pushing metering information to the platform in order to calculate the catalog usage.
