# Metering

The Metering page allows you to view annual data based on the data retention set specific for your installation. (A discussion of data retention is found in [Data management](/essentials-core/architecture/security-architecture#data-retention) in the Security Architecture topic.)

The Metering page provides the following functionality:

- Viewing service use by team and users
- Viewing user access to services
- CSV and MS Excel<sup>Â®</sup> exports of the selected data. 

> **Note**: Two dashes (--) appear for any data interval that has no data or has data in progress. Exports are also disabled if a chart has no data.
