# Catalog templates

Catalog templates are the definition for a solution. They enable you to properly integrate your Catalog service into Essentials Core. They denote the characteristics for a particular solution, how it interacts with the platform, and any requirements on that solution.

In particular, by defining appropriate user roles, settings, and request actions, Catalog service can be managed from the team's Settings page on Boomerang Launchpad.

Catalog templates support all types of catalog items: services, code assets, and recipes. Refer to [Working with the Catalog](/essentials-core/how-to-guide/catalog).

> **Note**: Settings and actions are optional and Catalog templates can simply be _links_ off to applications running externally to the platform. However, the full value of Catalog templates is harnessed when your Catalog service is running on the Boomerang platform.

The IBM Automation suite of applications all run on the Boomerang platform and have fully defined Catalog templates that allow teams to fully manage their applications from within the platform.

## Catalog management

The Catalog management page shows the following information about the created templates: **Name**, **Summary**, **Version**, **Access Level**, **Last Updated**, and **Published**.

Users can perform the following actions:

- Create template
- Edit template
- Publish and unpublish template
- Import templates
- Export templates

# Create template

Click **Create Template** in the upper right hand corner above the page and you will be redirected to the Create Catalog Template page. The tabs on the page allow you to view groups of parameters that will define the template you create.

Once you have filled in the minimum required Catalog fields, the **Create Template** button will be enabled.

## Overview

On the **Overview** tab, there are six required fields you must supply when creating a template.

| Field             | Description                                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Template URL**      | The URL that template instance use. Template URLs can be either a fully qualified URL such as `https://launch.boomerangplatform.net/cicd/apps` or a relative path can be specified like /apps/ci/teams for Catalog templates that are hosted on the platform, allowing templates to be portable across environments. Property syntax is also supported such as `${teamUrl}`. |
| **Category**          | The category of the template, for example, `Development`."  |
| **Version**           | The product version of the template.  |
| **Status**            | The platform-wide status of the template. Inactive templates cannot be added to a team.   |
| **Summary**           | The summary of the template for a Catalog product card. Maximum 128 characters.  |
| **Description**       | The description of the template for the Catalog product page. Supports Markdown. Maximum 4,000 characters. |
| **Featured Service**  | Featured services appear on the Launchpad Home screen for users that have access. Only services that have generic non-team specific URLs should be marked as featured.  |

### Status Watcher service

You can also elect to integrate the Catalog template with Boomerang's Status Watcher service:

![Catalog Overview Status](./assets/img/catalog/catalog-service-create-overview-status.png)

Here you can specify the `Watch Labels` Boomerang will watch for. When Boomerang detects a specified label, it will automatically trigger a new event recorded on the Boomerang Status page.

### Template icons

At the bottom of the Create Catalog Template page, you can upload different images related to your Catalog template.

| Type          | Description                                                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Icon image    | The image that will be displayed as the Catalog template icon. Support for .svg files only.                                   |
| Hero image    | The image that will be displayed as the main banner on the Catalog template information page. Support for .png files only.  |
| Product image | The image that will displayed on the image carousel on the Catalog template information page. Support for .png files only. |

## Attributes

The **Attributes** tab contains the following parameters.

| Attribute               | Description                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Admin Only**              | This template is visible to Administrator only. Administrator-only template items can't be used by regular platform users.  
|**Automated Cost** | Whether the template will have additional costs beyond the platform (for example, cost per user or based on service). |
**Automated Create Service** | Set whether Create Service requests made by a user will be automatically approved.      
| **Automated Join Service**    | Set whether Join a Service requests for this template can be automatically approved.  
| **Enable LDAP**             | Set whether you need Catalog service entitlements replicated in the Boomerang Platform LDAP. Enabled only for services that will connect to the Boomerang Platform LDAP. For example, the Boomerang Jira instance connects to the Boomerang LDAP for team, user, and role information. |
| **Externally Hosted**       | Set whether the Catalog service is not hosted on the platform.

| **Associated Cost**        | Set whether the template has additional costs beyond the platform.|
| **Requires VPN**            | Set whether the template requires a VPN connection for access.             
|**Third Party** | Whether the template is for a third party.

## Authorization

Click the `Authorization` tab to display the Authorization page.

Here you can create different roles that can be assigned to users for your Catalog template. To do so, enter a value for **Create role**.

You can also specify the **Default role** that will be assigned to users. Team Owners can assign one, many, or all of the created roles to a user on the Team Member's screen from Launchpad.

## Actions

Catalog actions are the mechanism to manage the lifecycle of your Catalog service. Catalog actions can be used to perform necessary steps before a Catalog item is available for use. Similarly, Catalog actions can be used to decommission a Catalog item.

To maximize the integration of a Catalog item with the Boomerang platform, teams will typically expose APIs in their services for Catalog actions to execute. Exposing APIs also increases the level of automation of the execution of Catalog actions.

Click the **Actions** tab. The Actions page is displayed.

![Catalog Actions](./assets/img/catalog/catalog-create-actions.png)

Here you can create actions that will be executed when requests for your Catalog service are processed. There are four categories of actions:

| Category | Description                                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Create**   | Actions to create an instance of a service for a team. |
| **Join**     | Actions to give a user access to a service.           |
| **Leave**    | Actions to revoke a users's access to a service.       |
| **Remove**   | Actions to remove a service from a team.               |

To create a new action, click the **Create new action** box for the appropriate action category. The associated action modal is displayed. For example, the Add action model is shown below.

![Catalog Actions New](./assets/img/catalog/catalog-create-actions-modal.png)

On any action modal, define these fields:

| Field/Attribute | Description                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Action Type**   | The type of Action to be executed. The values are `Flow`, `HTTP`, `Manual`, and `Set Property`.
| **Name**            | The name of the Action that will be displayed to the Admin processing the request.              |
| **Description**     | The description of the Action. For manual tasks this needs to be descriptive.                   |
| **Flow Team**     |  |

#### Flow

Flow actions enable a Flow workflow to be executed.

| Field/Attribute    | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Webhook Token**      | The API token used to identify the correct workflow to execute in Boomerang Flow. |
| **Property Key**, **Property Value** | Settings required by the workflow to execute.                                     |


### HTTP
These are HTTP requests to an internal platform server or an external server.

| Field/Attribute    | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **URL**      | The Target URL for the HTTP request. |
| **Method** | The set of request methods that indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource.   
**Internal**                              |
|**Content Type**  |   The Content-Type entity header is used to indicate the media type of the resource.
|**Payload** | The payload is an optional “body” to be sent with the request

#### Manual

Manual actions are used for actions that cannot be completed with an API. An Administrator might need to visit another URL to perform it. For example, creating a New Relic sub-account for a team must be done in the web application.

| Field/Attribute | Description                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **URL**             | (optional) The URL associated to the Manual action. |

#### Set property

Set Property actions allow arbitrary values to be set and then referenced later in the processing of the template. For example, we use a Set Property action to set the New Relic sub-account id created in a previous manual action. An Administrator must supply the value during the processing. For example, if the property set is `newRelicSubAccountId` then it can be substituted in the `Template URL` property with `https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/${newRelicSubAccountId}`. You can also reference the property in a HTTP request with the same `${propertyName}` syntax.

| Field/Attribute | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Property Key    | The key-value pair to be set by the Administrator processing the request. This property (setting) can be referenced on subsequent actions for the current category. |

There are also a number of properties automatically provided to the action.

| Property       | Description                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `teamName`       | Name of the team the tool is being created for      |
| `teamId`         | Unique identifier for team.                          |
| `requesterEmail` | User ID of user relating to request (if applicable) |
| `requesterName`  | First and last name of user who made the request (if applicable) |
| `requesterTeamRole` | Role of user in the team that made the request | 
| `organization`   | Organization name for team related to request |
| `purpose`        | User-provided purpose for the request |
| `serviceName` | Name of the catalog service in the request |
