# Uninstalling

Essentials Core has two methods for uninstalling: manual Helm<sup>Â®</sup> commands, and the Boomerang CLI.

## Boomerang CLI

> **Note**: Because Amazon EKS uses IAM to provide authentication to the Kubernetes cluster, `-v $HOME/.aws:/root/.aws` mount option should be added to the `docker run` command every time the CLI is executed against this platform.

```
docker run -it --network=host -v "$HOME/.kube/config:/cli/kubeconfig" tools.boomerangplatform.net:8500/public/ise/bmrg-util-cli:1.4.2 uninstall
```

>**Note**: The MongoDB persistent volume will not be removed, as this is installed with the Retain reclaim policy.

## Helm commands

Helm provides a method to uninstall, and even purge, all history of the Helm release.

We recommend that you create the PVCs for MongoDB with retain. You will manually need to clean up these objects.
