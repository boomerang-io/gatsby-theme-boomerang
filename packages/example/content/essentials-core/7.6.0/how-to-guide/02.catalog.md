# Working with the Catalog

Services, code assets, and recipes that are available to your team are displayed on the Catalog page.  Click the **Services**, **Code Assets**, or **Recipes** tab to view the associated items.  The Catalog page provides the following functionality:

- Filter the Catalog items
- Click an item to see more information about it and add it to your team
- View your team's Catalog details
- Delete a Catalog item from your team 
## Filtering Catalog items

You can search for an item using the Search field at the top of the header. You can also restrict the list produced using the filter parameters in the left panel. **Reset filters**, available in the left panel, allows you to clear the filters. 

| Available Filters | Description  | 
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Services** tab | The **Categories**, **Industries** and **Domain / Process Area** filter parameters narrow down the search results to Catalog services that are specific to a certain industry that was identified when the Catalog template for that service was created. See [Catalog templates](/essentials-core/how-to-admin/catalog). Service **Attributes** capture qualities of the services that are relevant to members. Services come in many flavors on the platform and attributes help make sense of it all. **Note** that the **Attributes** filter parameters do not affect filtering for Catalog services. These attributes are used by the code behind and refer to attributes that may have been assigned when service is created from a Catalog template. See [Catalog templates](/essentials-core/how-to-admin/catalog). |
| **Code Assets** tab | The **Types**, **Industries** and **Domain / Process Area** filter parameters narrow down the search results to Catalog services that are specific to a certain industry that was identified when the Catalog template for that service was created. See [Catalog templates](/essentials-core/how-to-admin/catalog). |
| **Recipes** tab | The filter parameters available for selection in the **Recipes** tab are those recipes that have been added to the teams that you are a member of. See [Adding services, code assets, and recipes to your team](/essentials-core/how-to-guide/catalog#Adding-services,-code-assets,-and-recipes-to-your-team).|

## Adding services, code assets, and recipes to your team

As a Team Owner, you can add a Catalog item that can be accessed by your team. The [Catalog](https://launch.boomerangplatform.net/catalog/) is the descriptive location where a Team Owner browses and adds the required items for their team.

In this procedure, adding a service will be demonstrated. The procedure also applies to adding a code asset or recipe.

1. From your team page in Launchpad, select the **Catalog Items** tab. Any currently active Catalog items, as well as any requests in progress for an item appear in this screen. 
2. Click **Add items in Catalog** to navigate to the Catalog page.

> **Note**: Catalog items can also be added to a team directly from the Catalog page. In this case, you will be asked to select a team before proceeding. You can only add items to teams in which you are a Team Owner.

3. If you have selected the **Services** or **Code Assets** tab, use the search and filter controls available in each tab to find the needed items for the team.

8. After an Administrator approves the create request, select **Admin** then **Requests**. There will be a join request for each team member. Not every team member has to have access to every catalog item.

9. When a join request is approved for a member, that user will be able to navigate to the **Catalog Items** tab in their team page in Launchpad and see that catalog item. If the item requested was a code asset, that item will appear in the right pane. Pending joins are also indicated.
