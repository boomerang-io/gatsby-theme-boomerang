## What's New in PDA 2.0.0

### Features

1. Supplements the exceptions list with a spreadsheet that presents details of process variants and FTE cost analysis.
1. Enhances the PDD with the optimal path, as well as rework and bottleneck reports.
1. Makes log data headers (CASE_ID, ACTIVITY, ROLE) more forgiving of capitalization (i.e., accepts variations such as 'Case ID', 'case-id', 'CaseId', 'Role', etc.)
1. Improves traceability with additional logging when a user generates a PDF of the PDA diagram.

### Fixes

- Fixes an issue where BPMN file size in the Manage Diagrams view was always 0 KB.
- Includes UI, performance and stability improvements.
