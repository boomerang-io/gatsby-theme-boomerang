## Known Issues

- Hovering the mouse over a line in the diagram will reveal the frequency metric. If no frequency is available for the line, no metric or prompt will appear.
- The diagram may fail to display if clickstream or log graphs have more nodes than the SOP graph.
- Very long node names may overflow their boxes on the diagram.
- Frequencies are currently reported as percentages, which can produce unintuitive results. This will be fixed by showing actual frequency counts instead of percentages.
- The lines for the Start and End nodes may not appear in the diagram.
- If a process model has a large number of nodes, it may take a very long time to re-render the diagram when clicking or unclicking the interaction checkboxes.

## Limitations

- PowerPoint (PPT) downloads are not available.
