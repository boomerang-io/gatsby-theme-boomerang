## What's New in PDA 1.4

### Features

1. PDA can ingest more complex Blueworks Live BPMN files (i.e., BPMN models with notification nodes, diagram edge labels, multiple end nodes and references to external diagrams)
1. PDA diagrams are enhanced with varying line thickness - thicker lines represent higher frequencies
1. Onscreen messaging is elaborated for BPMN file uploads

### Fixes

1. Improves Japanese and Italian language processing
1. Improves rendering of user roles in PDA diagrams
1. Improves traceability when users download PDD and Exception log files
1. Fixes issues where duration computations in preprocessor script were not accurate
1. Security improvements

### Notes

PDA will now detect roles in log and clickstream files only if the column caption is "ROLE_ID" ("RoleID" and other variants are not supported).
