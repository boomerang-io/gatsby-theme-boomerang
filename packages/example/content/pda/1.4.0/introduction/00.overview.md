## Overview

Process Discovery Accelerator (PDA) empowers automation consultants to quickly build business process models from the client's application event logs, clickstream data, system operating procedure (SOP) and BPMN documents.

## Features

- Event log files, clickstream data, SOP and BPMN documents can be analyzed alone or together to provide multiple views of the solution.
- If one or more input files are analyzed together, PDA will generate a harmonized process model that merges the process models from each data source. The lines of each individual process model can also be viewed together in overlay mode on an interactive PDA diagram.
- PDA exports industry-standard BPMN process models that can be imported into tools like Blueworks Live for further analysis.
- Most frequent and least frequent paths are easily visible on the interactive diagram.
- The input and results of each analysis are securely stored in the cloud.
- PDA is a cloud-native microservice solution that leverages the IBM Services Essentials for Automation platform for security, rapid development and run-time management.
