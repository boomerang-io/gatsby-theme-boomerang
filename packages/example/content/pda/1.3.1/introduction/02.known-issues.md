## Known Issues

- An error may occur when attempting to analyze BPMN, SOP and Clickstream files together.
- User roles in BPMN files may not be captured in PDA when the BPMN is analyzed with an SOP file.
- PDA will accept 4 types of input (SOP, BPMN, Clickstream and Log), but only 3 of them can be analyzed at one time.
- PDA assumes that the order of the rows in the input CSV files reflects the time sequence in which the events occurred. This can most often be achieved by sorting the rows by CASE_ID and TIMESTAMP in ascending order. If the rows are not in sequential order, unpredictable results may appear in the PDA diagram.
- A gateway that is in the Unassigned swimlane in a Blueworks Live BPMN may appear in an assigned lane of its connected nodes in PDA.
- Large diagrams may appear without grouping in PDA. However, the grouping is preserved when exporting to Blueworks Live.
- Unprintable characters may appear in the process model if the "Flatten conditional nodes" option is selected.
