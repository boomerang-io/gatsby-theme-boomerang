# Next Generation Worker

The next generation worker for Boomerang CICD is currently in beta and is based on the same engine driving Boomerang Flow. This allows processing of dynamic and complex pipelines using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

## How to enable

To enable this integration, navigate to your Boomerang CICD Stage configuration and under **Activity Settings** select the toggle for **Enable Generation 3 Worker Integration**.

You can specify Boomerang Flow workflow tokens separately for Build, Test, and Deploy. This means that you could create a custom Flow for Build and leave Test and Deploy as out-of-the-box Generation 2 workers.
