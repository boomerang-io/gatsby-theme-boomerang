## Executors

Executors allow for a dynamic range of orchestration engines to be used to execute on the activity. This is defined with the Boomerang CICD Mode.

- Extensibility through multiple orchestration tools or systems based on mode
- Swappable implementations
- Three current executors; Kubernetes native, IBM UrbanCode Deploy, and Boomerang Flow
- Source code driven automation enhancing collaboration
