# Known Issues

- Scorecard has limitations with the amount of data it can retrieve before a timeout occurs. For teams with a large number of components this will lead to consistent failures being shown. A fix is being worked on as part of the next release.

- Insights has limitations with the amount of data it can retrieve before a timeout occurs. For teams with a large number of components this will lead to consistent failures being shown.

- Lib has an issue with authentication with the latest JFrog Artifactory upgrade. We are working to resolve the issue. This will cause nothing to show up for teams in Lib.

- Documentation is in flux for the latest release. We are working extremely hard on getting this updated to match the functionality that is released.

# Limitations

- IBM Cloud GitLab SCM source does not have OAuth support which requires all git repositories / projects to be put under a specific IBM Cloud GitLab Organization.

- Caching is not currently enabled due to infrastructure constraints. We will be enabling this again in the future.
