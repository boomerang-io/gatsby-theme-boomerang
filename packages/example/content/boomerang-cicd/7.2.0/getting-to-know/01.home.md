Home is the centralized landing for Boomerang CICD with a summary of a number of the key data points including: components, pipelines, gates, and quick insights.

## Latest Component Activity

Up to five components will be shown here in order of latest activity displaying what this latest activity was and when. Additionally you can navigate to a specific one of these components or view all the components.

## Recently Used Pipelines

Will show a snapshot of detail on your teams pipelines. Providing the number of connected components, stages, and when it was last used.

## Latest Gate Evaluations

The evaluation activity for Boomerang Bosun policies is shown here providing a snapshot of what gates may have failed. For further detail you need to navigate through to Bosun / Policies to view additional detail.

## Quick Insights

Provides a snapshot of insights based on the last 30 days in two easy graphs focused on either Status or Activity trends.

With the Status insights you can see a split of the status of all the activity going on, idealy this will be with a high percentage of Succeeded.

Alternatively you can focus on the activity rate graph which should depict the trends across the activities being similar and identify outliers. For example if tests are not being run, then it will show that tests are not trending the same as builds and deploys. A key indicator of where to fix things.
