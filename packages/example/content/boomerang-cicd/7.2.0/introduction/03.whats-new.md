# What's New

Get a quick overview of what has been added, changed, improved, or deprecated in version 7.2.0 released 30th June 2020.

We focussed on a revamped CICD Scorecard application, stage configuration usability improvements and UI/UX enhancements.

## Scorecard

- Major redesign and reimplementation. A total overhaul of the UX, webapp and services.
- Scorecard "score" to assess the quality of a version based on weighted average of reports
- View all of the reports and key metrics for a component version at glance
- View detailed breakdown of individual reports
- View score history over time

## Stage Configuration

- Major redesign to improve UX
- Move configuration from a modal to a full-page experience
- Logically group configuration sections to ease configuration
- Add visualization for configured stage flow - see what is going to be executed, in what order
- See all of the activity configuration at once - build, test and deploy

## Approvals

- Notify users with the `approval` role on a CICD Team if there is an approval action required when notifications are enabled on the stage

## Pipelines

- Update Stage Configuration to use new feature
- Change stage reorder functionality to be an explicit mode, not the default behavior

## Workers

- Xcode 11.5 support for iOS projects

## UI/UX

- Upgrade to latest version of Carbon components
- Implement latest modal patterns from the Carbon Design System
- Add Skip to Content to improve accessibility

## Performance and Stability

- Major improvement to Scorecard performance. Average response time for summary and detailed services have been reduced by ~95% and have significantly reduced resource use on systems of record, especially third-party tooling.
