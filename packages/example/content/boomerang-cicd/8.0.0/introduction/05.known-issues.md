# Known issues & Limitations

- Insights has limitations with the amount of data it can retrieve before a timeout occurs. For teams with a large number of components, this will lead to consistent failures being shown.

- Lib has an issue with authentication with the latest JFrog Artifactory<sup>®</sup> upgrade. We are working to resolve the issue. This will cause nothing to show up for teams in Lib.

- IBM Cloud<sup>®</sup> GitLab<sup>®</sup> SCM source does not have OAuth support, which requires all Git repositories and projects to be put under a specific IBM Cloud GitLab organization.

- Caching is not currently enabled due to infrastructure constraints. We will be enabling this again in the future.
