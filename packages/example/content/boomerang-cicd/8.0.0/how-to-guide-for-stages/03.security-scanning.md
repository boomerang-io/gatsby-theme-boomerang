# Security scanning with data theorem

(To be announced)

# Security scanning with JFrog Xray

Every Docker<sup>®</sup> image that is built through Boomerang CICD is automatically scanned by JFrog Xray<sup>®</sup>. This scans your built artifacts for any known vulnerabilities and CVE present in your Docker image artifact, which includes your application code and any inherited Docker layers. This is enabled for all CI components and is accessible in Scorecard on the Component detail view under the Xray Issues tab.
