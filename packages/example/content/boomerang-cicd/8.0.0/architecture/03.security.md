# Security architecture

Boomerang CICD has a number of security protocols in place. The following architecture document provides detail on how these are applicable.

This is based on, and extends, the Boomerang Core Security and Framework architectures.

## Authorization

- Utilizes the Boomerang Core Global roles
- Utilizes the Boomerang Core Catalog Service Entitlement roles

**Roles**

| Level       | Role     | Access                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| global      | admin    | Full access to CICD. Ability to access and manage all teams and system.                                                                                       |
| global      | operator | Access to CICD across teams. Ability to access and manage all teams.                                                                                          |
| global      | user     | No access unless in a team with entitlement.                                                                                                                   |
| entitlement | user     | Default role for a CICD teams catalog service entitlement. Can do most functions other than those that are destructive. Can not perform CICD team management. |
| entitlement | operator | A custom CICD team catalog service entitlement. Elevates privileges to enable a user to perform destructive and management actions for a CICD team.           |
| entitlement | approver | A custom CICD team catalog service entitlement. Adds the ability for a user to approve Approval Gates.                                                        |

## Audit

Utilizes the Boomerang Core audit framework with data retention, based on the platforms configuration.

## SSL Certificates

Utilizes the Boomerang Core SSL certificate.

## Data management

Data is mainly stored in the following locations:

- CICD Activity Logs - Kubernetes<sup>®</sup> ephemeral storage and ingested by Elastic<sup>®</sup>
- Audit Logs - ingested by Boomerang Core
- Application Data - MongoDB
- Components Cache - Kubernetes Persistent Volumes (PV)
- Components Artifacts - JFrog Artifactory<sup>®</sup>
- Quality data - SonarQube, JFrog Artifactory, JFrog X-Ray

The following table provides an overview of the data management profile:

| Data Entity          | Storage       | PII | Customer Data | Source Code | Encrypted at Rest | Encrypted in Flight |

(\*) App-level encryption (\*\*) Disk-level encryption

### Data retention

- Backed up based on the platforms backup mechanism, and retained based on the platforms configuration.

## Encryption

Please review the Boomerang Platform _Security Architecture_.

## Kubernetes policies

Please review the Boomerang Platform _Security Architecture_ to understand the base level of policies used. The following describes the additional policies.

### Controller

The controller is the Kubernetes orchestrator and needs elevated permissions to be able to communicate with the Kubernetes API. To achieve this, we have a custom role defined with the appropriate Service Account bound to this role. The controller microservice runs as this Service Account.

See the Helm<sup>®</sup> chart for further in depth detail as to what Resource Groups and Verbs this role utilizes.

### Worker

The worker is the Kubernetes job that runs and executes the CICD activity. This worker needs some elevated permissions to be created and bound to the ConfigMap and PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim). To achieve this, we have a Service Account and a binding to a predefined role with only the required abilities.

## Workers

Every worker is a self-contained short-living execution runner. All source code, artifacts, keys, and secure values are only pulled into the worker as it is executing. The worker is removed upon completion.

### Docker image building

Under the covers we use `img`, which is more secure and runs unprivileged, in comparison to other methods such as Docker<sup>®</sup> in Docker. Docker in Docker exposes the host to the worker.

### Certificates

For mobile CI, certificates are required to sign the mobile applications. These certificates can be uploaded by the user, securely over HTTPS as an encrypted key store, and stored in a secure artifact repository controlled by RBAC. The password to the certificate is stored separately and is hashed by SHA256 and unretrievable once forgotten.
