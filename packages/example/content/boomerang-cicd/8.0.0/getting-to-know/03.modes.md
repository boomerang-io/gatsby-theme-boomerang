# Modes

Boomerang CICD is driven by modes and customized or extended by parameters. A mode tells Boomerang CICD what to do and allows you, as the user, to run activities in slightly different ways. It allows for specific functionality to be enabled, based on the underlying technology. It also denotes the infrastructure where we will create, run, and terminate the distributed workers. 

In essence, a mode is a predefined workflow of tasks, that take in Parameters to configure how things work. For example, passing `build.tool=gradle` into the Java<sup>®</sup> mode could switch from Maven to Gradle.

## Available Modes

Modes tell Boomerang CICD . The following table summarizes the modes available to you.

| **Mode** | **Support** |  **Useful For** |
| :---: | :---: | --- |
| [iOS](/boomerang-cicd/how-to-guide-for-modes/mode-is-i-os) | stable | Enables building iOS mobile applications on dedicated OSX infrastructure. |
| [android](/boomerang-cicd/how-to-guide-for-modes/mode-is-android) | stable | Enables building Android mobile applications on dedicated Linux<sup>®</sup> infrastructure. |
| [xamarin](/boomerang-cicd/how-to-guide-for-modes/mode-is-xamarin) | archived | Enables building Xamarin hybrid mobile applications using msbuild. |
| [java](/boomerang-cicd/how-to-guide-for-modes/mode-is-java) | stable | Specific to the creation of Java projects. This can optionally be packaged as a Docker<sup>®</sup> image. |
| [nodejs](/boomerang-cicd/how-to-guide-for-modes/mode-is-node-js) | stable | Specific to the creation of Node JavaScript<sup>®</sup> projects. This can optionally be packaged as a Docker image. |
| [python](/boomerang-cicd/how-to-guide-for-modes/mode-is-python) | stable | Specific to the creation of Python<sup>®</sup> projects. This can optionally be packaged as a Docker image. |
| [helm.chart](/boomerang-cicd/how-to-guide-for-modes/mode-is-helm-chart) | stable | Specific to the creation of Helm<sup>®</sup> Charts. |
| [docker](/boomerang-cicd/how-to-guide-for-modes/mode-is-lib-docker) | stable | Allows the packaging of a container, based on the instruction set in the `Dockerfile`. No additional tasks are performed prior to the `Dockerfile` and is useful if a multi-stage `Dockerfile` is being used. |
| lib.pod | stable | Enables building CocoaPods that can be hosted in Boomerang Lib. Also allows for super-fast internal downloads if used in the mobile application as part of the iOS mode. |
| lib.jar | stable | Enables building Java Archive (JARs) that can be hosted in Boomerang Lib. Also allows for super-fast internal downloads if used in the mobile application as part of other modes. _Constraint: This mode is not currently enabled to display any data via Scorecard. This will be enabled in a future beta release._ |
| lib.wheel | stable | Enables building python2-wheel and python3-wheel supported packages. That can be hosted in Boomerang Lib. _Constraint: This mode is not currently enabled to display any data via Scorecard. This will be enabled in a future release._ |

**Deprecated**

The following modes have been deprecated. This happens over time, as modes are no longer necessary or no longer utilized enough to warrant investment.

| **Mode** | **Useful For** |

| mff.adapter | Tuned to Mobile First Foundation and pre-installed with dependencies. |

## Boomerang Parameters file

Previously, we required all repositories connected to Boomerang CICD to include a `.boomerang.yaml` file, located in a `_boomerang` folder in the root directory of the Git repository. This is **no longer required** and is now an optional way of passing in parameters.

Additionally the `boomerang.properties` file can also be a YAML file `.boomerang.yaml`.

## Parameters

### Required Parameters

The only required parameter for a Component is the mode. This is provided at onboarding time.

```
mode=iOS/android/xamarin/java/nodejs/lib.jar/lib.pod/helm
```

### Mode Specific Parameters

Some modes have specific properties available and can be found in each specific Modes detail page.

### Notifications Parameters

The following parameters are optional and additional. These are usually set at the **stage** level.

```
#To enable slack notifications to a public broadcast channel and / or DM
notifications.slack.enable=true|false
notifications.slack.channel=#channel
notifications.slack.dm=@user

#To enable platform notifications
notifications.platform.enable=true|false
```

### Trigger Parameters

By default, Boomerang CICD performs a new activity for every Git push to your repository, once it's been connected and onboarded.

This includes all branches being worked on in your repository such as: main, develop, and feature branches.

You can provide custom behavior by modifying your `.boomerang.yaml` with the following filter parameters:

```
filter.target=tag/branch/all
filter.expression=^(\d+\.)?(\d+\.)?(\*|\d+)$
```

Here is an example of triggering from every Git push on your release branch.

```
filter.target=branch
filter.expression=^release$
```

Here is a case of triggering from every Git tag received in the format of 1.0.0.

```
filter.target=tag
filter.expression=^(\d+\.)?(\d+\.)?(\*|\d+)$
```

Here is a case of triggering from every push event (tag and branch) but filtered by either the developer and main branches, OR any tag in the format of 1.0.0.

```
filter.target=all
filter.expression=^((develop|main)|(\d+\.)?(\d+\.)?(\*|\d+))$
```

### Pipeline Parameters

To target a specific pipeline, the pipeline name is used and can be found from your Pipelines tab. Case is ignored.

```
pipeline.target=pipeline name
```

### Legacy properties

Prior to Parameters we used the Property syntax, the following are properties that are no longer used.

```
#Name of Product. Used throughout automation as a naming standard.
name=Product Name/Adapter name

#Identifier for the CI team
team.name=CI Team Identifier

#Replaced by notifications.slack.enable=true|false
notifications.type=slack

#Pipeline filtering. The filtering properties will need to be prefixed with `pipeline.<pipeline_name>.`, where `<pipeline_name>` is the name of the pipeline visible in CI.
pipeline.type=multi
pipeline.upgrade.filter.target=tag
pipeline.upgrade.filter.expression=^(\d+\.)?(\d+\.)?(\*|\d+)-upgrade(\.\d+)?$
```


<!-- ### Optional for Java, node.js, Python, and Docker modes

```
#To enable docker packaging
docker.enable=true
docker.image.name=ise-service-slack

#To deploy to helm. 
#A comma separated list of helm charts you want to deploy to
helm.chart=bmrg-cicd,bmrg-flow
#This property needs to match the set target in the values.yaml (has to be the same for all helm charts listed)
helm.image.tag=
``` -->
