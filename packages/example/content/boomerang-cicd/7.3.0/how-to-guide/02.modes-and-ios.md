# iOS mode

The iOS mode executes xcode-based commands to build, test, and deploy mobile artifacts.

## Boomerang properties

The following summarizes the properties that can be used in conjunction with `mode=iOS`. We recommend these be set at the `stage` or `version` property scope.

The below is a sample file `.boomerang.properties` file.

```
#General
mode=iOS
build.tool=xcode

#Refer to supported version table below for supported configurations
build.tool.version=9.4.1

#Cocoapods
cocoapods.enable=true
cocoapods.version=1.5.3
cocoapods.repo.update=true

#Carthage
carthage.enable=true

#Scheme name and folder path of your xcworkspace or xcproj
scheme.name=
scheme.folder=

#Slack Notifications
notifications.type=slack
notifications.slack.channel=
notifications.slack.dm=

#Filtering
filter.target=tag
filter.expression=^(\d+\.)?(\d+\.)?(\*|\d+)$
```

### Required properties

The following properties are required for `mode=iOS`.

```
mode=iOS
build.tool=xcode
build.tool.version=9.4.1

cocoapods.enable=true
cocoapods.version=1.1.0

scheme.name=
scheme.folder=
```

### Optional properties

| Property | Default Value  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `newrelic.applicationid` | - | The New Relic Application ID to upload to the Mobile DSYM |
| `set.version.number` | false | Automatically sets the version number of the iOS app to the Git tag |
| `set.build.number` | false | Automatically sets the build number of the iOS app to the Boomerang CICD build number |

### build.tool

`build.tool=` allows Boomerang CI to determine what type of engine and worker preconfiguration to apply. The options are as follows.

| **Build Tool** | **Version** | **Support** | **Operating System** | **Date Created** | **Useful For**                           |
| :------------: | :---------: | :---------: | :------------------: | :---: | ------------------------------------------------- |
|     xcode      |    10.2.1    |   stable    |  10.14 Mojave   | 04/25/18 | The base worker for iOS and CocoaPods activities. |
|     xcode      |    11.1.0    |   stable    |  10.14 Mojave   | 10/30/19 | The base worker for iOS and CocoaPods activities. |
|     xcode      |    11.2.1    |   stable    |  10.14 Mojave   | 12/02/19 | The base worker for iOS and CocoaPods activities. |
|     xcode      |    11.5    |   stable    |  macOS Catalina   | 06/15/20 | The base worker for iOS and CocoaPods activities. |

### cocoapods.enable

If `cocoapods.enable` is enabled in your properties file, you can specify additional CocoaPods parameters.

By default, the workers will *not* update the pod specification reference due to the poor performance of downloading the public specifications. The last update is based on the worker date created in the table above. If you wish to ensure the public specification reference is updated, add `cocoapods.repo.update=true` to your `.boomerang.properties` file.

### carthage.enable

If `carthage.enable` is enabled, it will be installed and available for your build. This allows you to run the Carthage copy-frameworks command as a post build phase step, as recommended by offical Carthage docs.  

```
/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks
```

## Prerequisites

### Xcode project setup

**Scheme settings**

Xcode projects schemes should be shared to allow automated builds through BoomerangCI.

In Xcode, navigate to `Product -> Scheme -> Manage Schemes`.

Ensure the scheme you want to build has been shared, as shown by the check box next to each scheme.

**Xcode signing and provisioning**

Turn off Automatic Signing in Xcode for your target. You will need to select the correct development profile and distribution profile for your application.

You can download your provisioning profiles from within Xcode itself by navigating to `Xcode -> Preferences -> Accounts`.

Under your team id for your enterprise team, click **view details**, then click **Download all profiles**. This downloads all the provisioning profiles for your team.

Set the correct provisioning profile for your Xcode configuration under the Signing section for your Xcode Target.

* Debug configuration will use a development profile.
* Release configuration will use a distribution profile.

If the required, provisioning profiles cannot be found by your Xcode project. You can manually enter the names.

1. In your project, go to Build Settings in Xcode.
2. Search for **Provisioning Profile**.
3. Expand the Provisioning Profile section and find the appropriate configuration, usually Debug, Release, or Production.
4. Select **other** on the target and enter the string name for your provisioning profile.

**Supplying custom provisiong profiles**

We recommend the use of an explicit profile over a wildcard profile. This ensures that we are reserving the namespace of the app ID for later use. When we need to enable services, the app ID is guaranteed to be available.

For Mobile@Scale, the bundle ID must match the following convention;

* com.ibm.gbs.mobilescale.\*

Request any new provisisong profiles for IBM ADEP here: [ADEP Request](https://w3-connections.ibm.com/wikis/home?lang=en-us#!/wiki/W4a398057b70b_448c_af67_7209960bc516/page/Request%20GBS%20Application%20Provisioning%20Artifacts).

You provide your own provisioning profiles by checking them in under the `_boomerang` folder in your Git repository, where you have placed your ".boomerang.properties" file.

**Team certificate signing**

When viewing the CI Component page, team certificates for both development and distribution signing can be uploaded securely through Boomerang CI. Click the Ribbon icon in the top right-hand of the page.

![Certificate Upload Buttton](./assets/img/boomerangci-signing-certifcate-button.png)

For iOS projects, you can provide either or both of the development and distribution signing certificates, along with the associated certificate profile. When signing your iOS application in CI, these will be imported and used to sign your application, depending on the provisiong profile you have configured for your application targets.

## Constraints

None at this time.
