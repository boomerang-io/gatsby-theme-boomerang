# Modes and properties

Boomerang CICD is driven by the mode and customized or extended by properties. A mode basically tells Boomerang CICD what and how it needs to do an activity. In essence, a mode is a predefined workflow of tasks. Properties feed into these modes and configure how things work. For example, passing `build.tool` into the Java<sup>®</sup> mode could switch from Maven to Gradle.

Previously, we required all repositorites connected to Boomerang CICD to include a `.boomerang.properties` file, located in a `_boomerang` folder in the root directory of the Git repository. This is **no longer required** and is now an optional way of passing in properties.

Additionally the `boomerang.properties` file can also be a yaml file `.boomerang.yaml`.

## Modes

Modes tell Boomerang CICD what to do and allows you, as the user, to run activities in slightly different ways. It allows for speific functionality to be enabled, based on the underlying technology. It also denotes the infrastructure where we will create, run, and terminate the distributed workers. The following table summarizes the modes available to you.

| **Mode** | **Support** |  **Useful For** |
| :---: | :---: | --- |
| [iOS](/boomerang-cicd/how-to-guide/mode-is-i-os) | stable | Enables building iOS mobile applications on dedicated OSX infrastructure. |
| [android](/boomerang-cicd/how-to-guide/mode-is-android) | stable | Enables building Android mobile applications on dedicated Linux<sup>®</sup> infrastructure. |
| [xamarin](/boomerang-cicd/how-to-guide/mode-is-xamarin) | archived | Enables building Xamarin hybrid mobile applications using msbuild. |
| [java](/boomerang-cicd/how-to-guide/mode-is-java) | stable | Specific to the creation of Java projects. This can optionally be packaged as a Docker<sup>®</sup> image. |
| [nodejs](/boomerang-cicd/how-to-guide/mode-is-node-js) | stable | Specific to the creation of Node JavaScript<sup>®</sup> projects. This can optionally be packaged as a Docker image. |
| [python](/boomerang-cicd/how-to-guide/mode-is-python) | stable | Specific to the creation of Python<sup>®</sup> projects. This can optionally be packaged as a Docker image. |
| [helm.chart](/boomerang-cicd/how-to-guide/mode-is-helm-chart) | stable | Specific to the creation of Helm<sup>®</sup> Charts. |
| [docker](/boomerang-cicd/how-to-guide/mode-is-lib-docker) | stable | Allows the packaging of a container, based on the instruction set in the `Dockerfile`. No additional tasks are performed prior to the `Dockerfile` and is useful if a multi-stage `Dockerfile` is being used. |
| lib.pod | stable | Enables building CocoaPods that can be hosted in Boomerang Lib. Also allows for super-fast internal downloads if used in the mobile application as part of the iOS mode. |
| lib.jar | stable | Enables building Java Archive (JARs) that can be hosted in Boomerang Lib. Also allows for super-fast internal downloads if used in the mobile application as part of other modes. _Constraint: This mode is not currently enabled to display any data via Scorecard. This will be enabled in a future beta release._ |
| lib.wheel | stable | Enables building python2-wheel and python3-wheel supported packages. That can be hosted in Boomerang Lib. _Constraint: This mode is not currently enabled to display any data via Scorecard. This will be enabled in a future release._ |

**Deprecated**

The following modes have been deprecated. This happens over time, as modes are no longer necessary or no longer utilized enough to warrant investment.

| **Mode** | **Useful For** |
| :---: | :---: |
| mff.adapter | Tuned to Mobile First Foundation and pre-installed with dependencies. |

## Properties

Properties are an important aspect of Boomerang CICD and can be set at many different layers in the application. Properties are subsituted at execution time. Properties can be a very powerful mechanism to configure a mode or provide advanced input.

Six property scopes in the order of precedence:
- System
- Global
- Team
- Stage
- Component
- Version

### Property availability

Properties follow a layering mechanism and are substitued at execution time in this order. For example a property specified at both the stage and component level, will lead the `component` property to override the `stage` property, unless read in via scope.

| Scope | Description | Syntax | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| System | Properties defined by Boomerang CICD that are used to drive system-wide functionality. Only some of these are configurable post install and are currently available in the Admin settings page. | `${p:system/property}`  | \${p:system/mode} |
| Global | Properties set in the Manage Properties screen in Boomerang CICD. These properties are useful for overarching control, such as the systems Artifactory credentials or the Global Notifications channel. These are set and maintained by the platform Administrators. | `${p:global/property}` | \${p:global/notifications.slack.channel} |
| Team | Properties specific to that team. This could be a credential for access to an MDM or deployment target. These are available on the Manage Team Properties page.  | `${p:team/property}`      | \${p:team/maas360.username} |
| Stage | Properties specific to a point in time of the activity. For example, deployment properties such as a Kubernetes namespace that is different each time. These can be set in the Stage Configuration Modal. | `${p:stage/property}` | \${p:stage/kubernetes.namespace} |
| Component | Properties specific to a component that are persisted for whatever is being done with that component. This could be Git-related information or a specific requirement for a mode, such as build tool. These are available on the Configuration tab of each component on the Components page. | `${p:component/property}` | \${p:component/build.tool} |
| Version | A property for a specific version. These are stored in the `.boomerang.properties` file and can be different for every version created by a trigger. Previously, these were the only layer of property available to end users and are now mainly deprecated, with component properties used in their place. | `${p:version/property}` | |

### Without scope

A property can be referred to without scope as `${p:property}`. If this happens, the property layer that is available is based on the order of precedence, from highest to lowest in the stack of scopes. For example, if you have two properties defined, one at the team and one at the component, the `component` property will be used. 

### Properties required for all modes

```
mode=iOS/android/xamarin/java/nodejs/lib.jar/lib.pod/helm
build.tool=xcode/maven/gradle/npm
build.tool.version=8.3.1/3.3.9
```

### Properties specific to a mode

Some modes have specific properties available and can be found in each specific Modes detail page.

### Properties for notifications

The following properties are optional and additional. These are usually set at the **stage** level.

```
#To enable slack notifications to a public broadcast channel and / or DM
notifications.slack.enable=true|false
notifications.slack.channel=#channel
notifications.slack.dm=@user

#To enable platform notifications
notifications.platform.enable=true|false
```

### Optional for Java, node.js, Python, and Docker modes

```
#To enable docker packaging
docker.enable=true
docker.image.name=ise-service-slack

#To deploy to helm. 
#A comma separated list of helm charts you want to deploy to
helm.chart=bmrg-cicd,bmrg-flow
#This property needs to match the set target in the values.yaml (has to be the same for all helm charts listed)
helm.image.tag=
```

### Properties for filtering

By default, Boomerang CI performs a new activity for every Git push to your repository, once it's been connected with your chosen repository.

This includes all branches being worked on in your repository such as: master, develop, and feature branches.

You can provide custom behavior by modifying your `.boomerang.properties` with the following filter properties

```
filter.target=tag/branch/all
filter.expression=^(\d+\.)?(\d+\.)?(\*|\d+)$
```

Here is an example of triggering from every Git push on your release branch.

```
filter.target=branch
filter.expression=^release$
```

Here is a case of triggering from every Git tag received in the format of 1.0.0.

```
filter.target=tag
filter.expression=^(\d+\.)?(\d+\.)?(\*|\d+)$
```

Here is a case of triggering from every push event (tag and branch) but filtered by either the developer and master branches, OR any tag in the format of 1.0.0.

```
filter.target=all
filter.expression=^((develop|master)|(\d+\.)?(\d+\.)?(\*|\d+))$
```

### Pipeline target property

CI supports targetting a specific pipeline. This is enabled by specifying the following properties in your `.boomerang.properties` file.

The pipeline name is used and can be found from your Pipelines tab. Case is ignored.

```
pipeline.target=pipeline name
```

### Legacy properties

```
#Name of Product. Used throughout automation as a naming standard.
name=Product Name/Adapter name

#Identifier for the CI team
team.name=CI Team Identifier

#Replaced by notifications.slack.enable=true|false
notifications.type=slack

#Pipeline filtering. The filtering properties will need to be prefixed with `pipeline.<pipeline_name>.`, where `<pipeline_name>` is the name of the pipeline visible in CI.
pipeline.type=multi
pipeline.upgrade.filter.target=tag
pipeline.upgrade.filter.expression=^(\d+\.)?(\d+\.)?(\*|\d+)-upgrade(\.\d+)?$
```
