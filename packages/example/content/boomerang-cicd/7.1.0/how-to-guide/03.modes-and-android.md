# Android mode

The android mode will execute gradle based commands to build, test, and deploy mobile artifacts.

## Boomerang Properties

The following summarizes the properties that can be used in conjunction with `mode=android`. These are recommended to be set at the Stage or Version property scope.

The below is a sample file `.boomerang.properties` file.

```
#General
mode=android
build.tool=gradle
build.tool.version=26.0.2/4.6

#Android application folder to be built. Mandatory.
android.module=app

#Android sdk folder to be built. Optional.
android.sdk=sdk

#Slack Notifications
notifications.type=slack
notifications.slack.channel=
notifications.slack.dm=

#Filtering
filter.target=tag
filter.expression=^(\d+\.)?(\d+\.)?(\*|\d+)$
```


### Required Properties

The following properties are required for `mode=android`

```
mode=android
build.tool=gradle
build.tool.version=26.0.2/4.6
android.module=app
```

### build.tool

`build.tool=` allows Boomerang CI to determine what type of build script to apply.  Gradle is the primary supported build tool for Android projects. Since gradle is flexible and there are many different ways you can structure your Android project we recommend this approach so Boomereang CI will build your app consistently.

### build.tool.version

`build.tool.version=` allows Boomerang CI to determine the correct version of the build tools and gradle version to use to build your app.  This field is two parts separated by a slash.  The first part is the Android SDK version and the second part is the gradle tool version.

#### Android SDK

| **Version** |
| :---------: |
|    20.0.0   |
|    21.1.2   |
|    22.0.1   |
|    23.0.2   |
|    23.0.3   |
|    24.0.0   |
|    24.0.1   |
|    24.0.2   |
|    24.0.3   |
|    25.0.1   |
|    25.0.2   |
|    25.0.3   |
|    26.0.0   |
|    26.0.2   |
|    27.0.1   |
|    27.0.2   |
|    27.0.3   |
|    28.0.2   |
|    28.0.3   |

#### Gradle

| **Version** | **Support** | **Useful For**                                                                    |
| :---------: | :---------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    4.6      |   stable    | Defines the execution tasks for compiling an android app on a Linux based worker. |

### android.module

`android.module=` is the source code folder where Boomerang CI will build the `.apk`.  This is a mandatory field.

### android.sdk

`android.sdk=` is the source code folder where Boomerang CI will build the `.aar` file.  Optional field.

## Flavors

If you have build flavors in your source code ensure you advise the Boomerang support team.  They will link a build flavor to each stage in your pipeline.

## Prerequisites

A `build.gradle` file is required to be present in the root folder of the repository for the build to be successful. This file shouldn't need to have any android build configuration included. Below is a sample file:

```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.0.0'
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
    }
}

tasks.matching {it instanceof Test}.all {
    testLogging.events = ["failed", "passed", "skipped"]
}
```

Next, you will be creating a `settings.gradle` in the root directory, this will define all your submodules, at a minimum you would have one app for android modules.

```
include ':app'
```

Finally, your Android project source code is stored in a subfolder matching the name of your Gradle submodule in your root directory. This folder will also have its own `build.gradle` file which will specify all your Android build configuration. The folllwing is an example of this:

```
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

android {

    compileSdkVersion 26
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.ibm.helloworld"
        minSdkVersion 26
        targetSdkVersion 26
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
        testInstrumentationRunner "android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
    }

    buildTypes {
         prod {
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }

        release {
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }

        debug {
            applicationIdSuffix ".debug"
            debuggable true
            testCoverageEnabled = true
        }
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
    implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:26.1.0'
    implementation 'com.android.support.constraint:constraint-layout:1.0.2'
    implementation 'com.android.support:design:26.1.0'
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.12'
    androidTestImplementation 'com.android.support.test:runner:1.0.1'
    androidTestImplementation 'com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.0.1'
}
```

**Build variants vs Product flavours**

We recommend for you to handle enviroment configuration through specifying build variants rather than product flavours. At this stage product flavours aren't supported via the Boomerang CI pipeline but will be coming in a future update.

**Team Certificate Signing**

Team certificates for both development and distribution signing can be uploaded securely through Boomerang CI when viewing the CI Component page by clicking on the type right corner "Ribbon" icon.

For Android projects you can provide a custom Java Keystore (JKS) file for use for code signing your Android application.

## Constraints

None at this time.
