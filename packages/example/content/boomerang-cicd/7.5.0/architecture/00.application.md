_Notes:_

1. Optional sidecars are what is known at the Application layer. This does not include any DaemonSets defined at the Infrastructure or Orchestrator layer.
2. Executors are a concept that allow CI to be extended to work with multiple different orchestration tools to executor the build, test, and deploy activities. There are now three such executors: IBM UrbanCode Deploy, Kubernetes native, and Boomerang Flow (_alpha integration_).
3. The workers have implemented, and are bound to, specific RBAC privileges in Kubernetes.
4. The worker is a fork of the open source Boomerang-io Flow worker.
5. The controller is the same controller as the open source Boomerang-io Flow controller microservice with a separate profile for CICD and some customizations. However, in future releases we will be looking to feature parity.

**Integrations to enable functionality**

| Dependency         | Implementation               | Version | Description                                                             |

## Bosun

For the policy functionality, CICD relies on the Open Source Boomerang-io Bosun project. This can be enabled at installation time in the Helm<sup>®</sup> chart.

| Component | Type | Technology | Internal to Internal | External Ingress | Internal Dependency | External Dependency | Optional Sidecars |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bosun | Front End | React + Node.js | Bosun MS | true | | | |
| Policy | Microservice | Spring Boot (Java) | Repository MS | true | MongoDB, OpenPolicyAgent | | New Relic APM |
| Repository | Microservice | Spring Boot (Java) | | false | SonarQube, JFrog XRay | | New Relic APM |
| OpenPolicyAgent | Middleware | Go | | false | | | |

_Notes:_

1. Optional sidecars are what is known at the application layer. This does not include any DaemonSets defined at the Infrastructure and Orchestrator layer.
2. Repository microservice is not required to be integrated to the dependencies. This is required only if you used the predefined integrations, as opposed to passing in an already retrieved payload.
3. [OpenPolicyAgent](https://openpolicyagent.org/) is a third-party open source component that Bosun wraps.
