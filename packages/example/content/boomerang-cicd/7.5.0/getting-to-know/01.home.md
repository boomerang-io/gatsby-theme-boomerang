## Quick insights

Provides a snapshot of insights based on the last 30 days in two easy graphs, focused on either Status or Activity trends.

Status insights presents a split of the status of all the activity going on. Ideally, this will be with a high percentage of succeeded.

Alternatively, you can focus on the activity rate graph which should depict the trends across the activities being similar, as well as identifying outliers. For example, if tests are not being run, then it will show that tests are not trending the same as builds and deploys. This is a key indicator of where to fix things.
