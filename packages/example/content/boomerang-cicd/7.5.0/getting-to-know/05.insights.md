### Implementing New Relic

The following information will help in implementing New Relic in your GBS Tool.

#### Access to New Relic
If you need access to New Relic, navigate to [Boomerang Launchpad](https://launch.boomerangplatform.net) and create a new team request with New Relic as the tool.

#### Add New Relic to a Browser Tool
Read and understand the [New Relic Browser documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/install-new-relic-browser-agent) to understand how to install. A number of the tools go the route of Copy and Paste JavaScript<sup>®</sup>.

#### Browser user tracking
For the Browser tools, when tracking the number of users, its important to set the User ID after login and then send a page action to New Relic. Sample code is as follows:

```
// Set custom attribute in newrelic agent for user page action tracking
// https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/set-custom-attribute
newrelic.setCustomAttribute('userId', currentUserId);

 
// send custom page action to newrelic with json object
// https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/add-page-action
newrelic.addPageAction(actionName, jsonObject);
```
