# Working with Task Manager

The Task Manager page displays all currently defined tasks in the IBM Services Essentials platform, and allows you to monitor their status, as well as edit, add, and delete tasks.
## Viewing tasks

The left panel displays the currently defined tasks by group. 

Expand each group to view its related tasks.  The parameters that are configured for each task in a group are displayed. Verified tasks are indicated by a ribbon icon.
### Task header

The top of each task definition presents task version control. The name of the task, along with the date the task was last updated is displayed.

The **Version** control in the task header allows you to cycle through past versions of the task. When viewing the current version, **Reset changes** can be used to reset any editing you have done. When viewing a previous version, the parameters from that version can be copied into a new version using **Copy to new version**.

### Task definition

Task definitions are presented in as: **Basics** and **Definition fields**
