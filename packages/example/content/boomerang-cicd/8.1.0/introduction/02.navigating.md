## Home page

Home is the centralized landing for Boomerang CICD with a summary of a number of the key data points including: components, pipelines, gates, and quick insights. From here, you create components, pipelines, gates, approvals, and notifications that move the components through the pipeline.

- **Latest component activity**    
This tile displays the latest activity, along with what the activity was and when it occurred. 

  Click **View all components** to display the [Components](/boomerang-cicd/getting-to-know/components) details page. Here, up to five components are displayed in order of latest activity.

- **Recently used pipelines**   
Pipeline information is a snapshot of detail on your team's pipelines. Information includes the number of connected components, stages, and when it was last used.

  Click **View all pipelines** to display the [Pipelines](/boomerang-cicd/getting-to-know/pipelines) details page. 

- **Latest gate evaluations**  
The evaluation activity for Boomerang Bosun policies is shown here providing a snapshot of what gates may have failed. Click **View Bosun** to view additional details for Bosun and policies.

- **Quick insights**  
  Provides a snapshot of insights based on the last 30 days in two easy graphs, focused on either Status or Activity trends.

  Status insights presents a split of the status of all the activity going on. Ideally, this will be with a high percentage of succeeded.

  Alternatively, you can focus on the activity rate graph which should depict the trends across the activities being similar, as well as identifying outliers. For example, if tests are not being run, then it will show that tests are not trending the same as builds and deploys. This is a key indicator of where to fix things.
