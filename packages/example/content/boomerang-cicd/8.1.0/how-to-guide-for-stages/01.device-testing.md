# Mobile Device Testing

The chosen provider for Boomerang@IBM is Sauce Labs<sup>®</sup> Device Cloud.

## Sauce Labs

### First time application registration

As part of using Sauce Labs, you need to upload your application the first time so SauceLabs can generate a unique testing API key. This API key will be used by Boomerang CICD to execute the automated tests.

1. Navigate to Sauce Labs from the tile on your Team page on Boomerang Launchpad. Log in with the credentials provided by the Boomerang support team.
2. Click **New App**.
3. Click **Android/iOS App**.
4. Drag-and-drop your APK or IPA file or click **Choose File**.
5. Confirm the  **App Name** and **Version**, then click **Save**.
6. Confirm the **Device Settings** and click **Save**.
7. Hover over **Automated Testing** and click **Appium**.
8. Click **Setup Instructions**.
9. Copy your `testobject_api_key`.

### Live testing

From the Sauce Labs main Apps page you can select an application and a version to test interactively with Sauce Labs.

1. Select the application to live test.
2. Click **Live Testing**.
3. From the online catalog, select the device to use, then click **Open Device**.
4. Take note of the `Device Name`.

Your application is installed on the device and started.

## Appium

Appium<sup>®</sup> is the preferred tool to capture the test scripts for automated playback with Sauce Labs. Testers use a locally installed instance of Appium, connected remotely to Sauce Labs to capture test scripts by directly interacting with the application.

### Installation

1. Download the appropriate Appium install for your platform. See [Appium](http://appium.io/)
2. Install Appium.

### Configuring an inspector session

1. Start Appium.
2. From the Appium Home menu, select **New Session Window...**.
3. Select **TestObject** from the list of servers.
4. Paste the `testobject_api_key` you captured earlier when performing first time registration of your application with Sauce Labs.
5. Select `US` in the **TestObject Data Center** dropdown.
6. Click **Desired Capabilities**.
7. Click **+**.
8. Add  `platformName` and either `Android` or `iOS`.
9. Click **+**.
10. Add `platformVersion` and whatever version of `Android` or `iOS` you wish to use. For example, `8` for Android or `11.3` for iOS.
11. Click **+**.
12. Add `deviceName` and the **Device Name** you captured earlier when running a live test on your application
13. Click **Save**.
14. Click **Start Session**.

Appium connects to Sauce Labs, where your application will be installed and started on a device of the version and type you specified. Once the application starts, Appium will connect to the running instance and display your application. You can interact with your application with Appium and record scripts.

### Recording a test script

The following steps illustrate how to capture a test script which can be executed against Sauce Labs, as part of the automated Boomerang CICD process.

1. Appium loads and displays three panels from left to right: Simulator, App Source, and Selected Element.
2. Click **Select Elements**

3. Click **Start Recording** and ensure **Java - JUnit** is selected from the dropdown menu in the newly opened Recorder panel

4. Select an element from the Simulator panel. The App Source and Selected Element panels update with details of the selected element.

5. Click **Tap** in the Selected Element panel. You will see some JUnit Java code appear in the Recorder panel. This is your test script.

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 to compile your end-to-end test script. Once you have captured your test, click **Copy code to clipboard** and save your script in a new file with a `.java` extension.

7. Repeat steps 1 through 6 for each test script you need. Be sure to name each `.java` file in alphabetical sort order if your tests need to be executed in order.

## CI Configuration

The following section provides the instructions to configure your application to execute your catalog of device test scripts each time it is built through Boomerang CICD

### Test folder

The following steps require access to the application source code repository. If you do not have access, you will need to contact a developer in your team who has access and ask them to execute these steps.

1. Clone the application source code repository to your local machine.
2. Change directory to the cloned repository.
3. Create a new folder for storing the `.java` test script files created earlier. Take a note of the new **Folder Name**.
4. Copy all the captured `.java` files to **Folder Name**.
5. Commit changes and push.

### Test properties

Like the test folder, test properties also require access to the application source code repository.

1. Change directory to the `_boomerang` folder.
2. Edit `.boomerang.yaml` and add the following properties:

As a starting point use the values you captured as part of your Appium test script capture.

```
scheme.folder.test=<your folder name>
testobject.api.key=<your API key>
testobject.upload.user=<your SauceLabs user name>
testobject.device.name=<deviceName>
testobject.device.platform=<platformName>
testobject.device.platform.version=<platformVersion>
```

3. Commit changes and push.

### Enabling device testing on your pipeline

Contact your Boomerang Support team using your team Slack<sup>®</sup> channel and ask for Device Testing to be enabled on your pipeline. This task is quick and is effective immediately. The next build push or tag Boomerang CICD will automatically upload the new application APK or API to Sauce Labs and execute each of your test scripts. You can log into Sauce Labs and watch a replay of the test executions.
