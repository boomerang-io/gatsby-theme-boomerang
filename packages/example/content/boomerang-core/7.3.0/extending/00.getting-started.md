# Getting started

Boomerang core provides developer APIs and frameworks for popular languages to build, extend, and hook into functionality provided by the platform.

By integrating these frameworks into your solution, you will solution will be granted:

- **Authentication** - Easy access to user identity for all incoming requests.
- **Authorization** - Read-only access to users teams and roles for your solution.
- **Audit** - Write-only access publish audit events for the solution which can be viewed in Admin.
- **Notification** - Publish notification events targetted towards specific users, teams, or global to all users of a catalog item.
- **Logging** - Consistent logging format.
- **Settings** - Read-only access to Catalog properties that have been defined at a global level and a team level.

This topic provides the API documentation, library installation and usage instructions for these frameworks.

## Platform security

All platform APIs are protected by service tokens, by scope type of **core**. Developers need to follow the how-to guide for service tokens to generate a token that will be used to access platform services.

Once creating a service type of scope type \*_core_, this must not be checked in under source control and should be held in external configuratioon outside your application in a Kubernetes Secret, for example.

All cores services expect an HTTP header with the key 'x-access-token' and value of the token that was provided on the Boomerang Admin application.

```shell
x-access-token: "644ab012-6884-473f-a2b3-d28537b7d2af"
```

This token is used to identify and verify applications that are accessing core services and is scopoed to only your catalog item.

## Access to libraries

All frameworks are hosted on the Boomerang Artifactory Instance at [https://tools.boomerangplatform.net/artifactory/](https://tools.boomerangplatform.net/artifactory/).

### Retrieve Artifactory API token

1. Navigate to the [Boomerang Artifactory instance](https://tools.boomerangplatform.net/artifactory).
2. Log in and select the **User** dropdown on the top right of the page. Select **Edit Profile**.
3. Under the Authentication Settings header, select the âš™ icon to generate an API key and save it. Copy the key and keep it handy. You will need it soon.

### Java (Maven)

Maven is configured using a settings.xml file located under your Maven home directory (typically, this will be /user.home/.m2/settings.xml). For more information on configuring Maven, see [Apache Maven Project Settings Reference](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html).

Include repositories tag snippet in your maven pom.xml file. This will enable the inclusion for the Java frameworks.

1. Setup the Maven `settings.xml` file in your \$M2_HOME directory

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.1.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.1.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.1.0.xsd">
   <servers>
      <server>
         <username>${security.getCurrentUsername()}</username>
         <password>${security.getEscapedEncryptedPassword()!"*** Insert encrypted password here ***"}</password>
         <id>central</id>
      </server>
      <server>
         <username>${security.getCurrentUsername()}</username>
         <password>${security.getEscapedEncryptedPassword()!"*** Insert encrypted password here ***"}</password>
         <id>snapshots</id>
      </server>
   </servers>
   <profiles>
      <profile>
         <repositories>
            <repository>
               <snapshots>
                  <enabled>false</enabled>
               </snapshots>
               <id>central</id>
               <name>boomeranglib-maven-virtual</name>
               <url>https://tools.boomerangplatform.net/artifactory/boomeranglib-maven-virtual</url>
            </repository>
            <repository>
               <snapshots />
               <id>snapshots</id>
               <name>boomeranglib-maven-virtual</name>
               <url>https://tools.boomerangplatform.net/artifactory/boomeranglib-maven-virtual</url>
            </repository>
         </repositories>
         <pluginRepositories>
            <pluginRepository>
               <snapshots>
                  <enabled>false</enabled>
               </snapshots>
               <id>central</id>
               <name>boomeranglib-maven-virtual</name>
               <url>https://tools.boomerangplatform.net/artifactory/boomeranglib-maven-virtual</url>
            </pluginRepository>
            <pluginRepository>
               <snapshots />
               <id>snapshots</id>
               <name>boomeranglib-maven-virtual</name>
               <url>https://tools.boomerangplatform.net/artifactory/boomeranglib-maven-virtual</url>
            </pluginRepository>
         </pluginRepositories>
         <id>artifactory</id>
      </profile>
   </profiles>
   <activeProfiles>
      <activeProfile>artifactory</activeProfile>
   </activeProfiles>
</settings>
```

Include the `<repositories>` xml snippet at the root level of your pom file to gain access to frameworks.

```xml
<repositories>
 <repository>
 <id>boomeranglib-java</id>
 <url>https://tools.boomerangplatform.net/artifactory/boomeranglib-java</url>
 </repository>
</repositories>
```

### Node.js (npm)

You need to configure your npm client to access our `@boomerang` packages hosted on Artifactory. Run the following command:

```shell
npm config set @boomerang:registry https://tools.boomerangplatform.net/artifactory/api/npm/boomeranglib-npm/
```

See [npmrc documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/configuring-npm/npmrc.html) for more information.


### Python

## Install

To resolve packages using pip, add the following to ~/.pip/pip.conf:

```shell
[global]
index-url = https://<username>:<artifactory_key>@tools.boomerangplatform.net/artifactory/api/pypi/boomeranglib-pypi/simple
```

Run pip to install

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Troubleshooting

If you used `curl` and are receiving `403` errors, try the command again with the `-o` flag to pipe the response to the `.npmrc` file. People have encountered issues when copy and pasting directly from the terminal.

## Access to services from local machine

You can make use of kubectl port forwarding feature to forward the core service deployed in a local development environment to verify auth lib is working correctly.

`https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/`

For example to port forward Auth Service:

```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/bmrg-core-services.auth 8080:80
```

This ports forward the Auth service in the environment to your local machine and serve it on port 8080. You can then update your application.properties file to use localhost:8080.

> Note: For the service name, provide the fully qualified DNS name for the service, which includes the namespace, which can vary between environments. Reach out to the SRE representative for the exact service name.
