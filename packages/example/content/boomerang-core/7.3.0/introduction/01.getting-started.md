> There is an admin platform-wide setting for automatic team creation. If that is enabled, then your team would be automatically created upon submitting the form. Otherwise, your form submission will generate a team creation request that will have to be approved by an administrator.

## Join a Team

1. From the Launchpad desktop, click `Join / create a team`.
2. Search for a team based on its name. Select your team in the search list and click `Request to join`.

> Only teams that are not private will show here.

## Share Link

If you have been provided a unique share link by your team owner, you will be navigated to Launchpad automatically with you request automatically processed to join the team.
