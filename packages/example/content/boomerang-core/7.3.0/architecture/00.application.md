**Dependencies**

The following platform-wide dependencies are prior to, and in addition to, any dependencies for the additional components, such as Core.

## Core

Core is the centralized enabler and common services for a platform. It provides an architecture and application functionality to create an interoperable set of services that can be brought together to create applications. 

This creates a collection of technology capabilities and components that enable you to build upon it. The Core exposes upward services for applications to run, that enable the rapid development of those applications. Ensuring a common consistent approach, methods, implementation, and helping, provide a wholelistic joint experience, opposted to disparate custom microservices.

Core allows applications to be designed and constructed agnostic to the underlying infrastructure or security protocols.

### Resource requirements

The minimum resource specification requirements for running these components in non-HA, and not including middleware. This is the minimum starting requirement, not the running requirement based on usage patterns. The memory and CPU will increase with usage.

| Implementation | CPU    | Memory | Disk           |
| -------------- | ------ | ------ | -------------- |
| Core           | 1 vCPU | 2.2 GB | No Persistence |
| Core Lite      | 1 vCPU | 1.6GB  | No Persistence |

_Notes:_

1. Optional sidecars are what is known at the application layer. This does not include any DaemonSets defined at the Infrastructure or Orchestrator layer.
2. The OpenLDAP<sup>®</sup> requires an LDIF (LDAP data interchange format) to be applied to alter `groupOfUniqueNames`
