# Rolling Back

Whether installing or upgrading, the recommended approach to rolling back is that you: 

1. Scale down all pods.
2. Replace the database with the backup taken.
3. Run the Helm<sup>Â®</sup> install or Helm upgrade commands with the the intended version.

Installations and upgrades run a data loader that not only loads new data, but can migrate the data structure. For this reason, it is difficult and fraught with danger to try and do a scripted rollback, as we won't necessarily know the previous version.
