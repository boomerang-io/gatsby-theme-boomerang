# Uninstalling

Boomerang Core has two methods for uninstalling: manual Helm<sup>Â®</sup> commands, and the Boomerang CLI.

## Boomerang CLI

```
docker run -it --network=host -v "$HOME/.kube/config:/cli/kubeconfig" tools.boomerangplatform.net:8500/public/ise/bmrg-util-cli:1.3.0 uninstall
```

> NOTE: The MongoDB persisent volume will not be removed, as this is installed with the Retain reclaim policy.

## Helm commands

Helm provides a method to uninstall, and even purge, all history of the Helm release.

We recommend that you create the PVCs for MongoDB with retain. You will manually need to clean up these objects.
