# Overview

The Boomerang Platform is your IBM Services Essentials platform that accelerates continuous delivery with quality. Boomerang provides a modern flexible way to enable DevOps, and supports an Agile culture.

Delivery can be complex when the use or adoption of tools alone is not the solution. Boomerang bridges the gap between tools, and ties them together into a consistent and harmonized experience. Boomrang provides a common, centralized, and secure platform for all your tools, services, and applications. This approach accelerates development and delivery.

Boomerang is a multiple technology, hybrid cloud platform, tailored for IBM Services delivery. Bringing together the full DevOps lifecycle through one seamless platform, and backed by a hybrid, centralized, and distributed continuous integration system, we balance speed and flexibility with quality.

## Background

The platform was originally created by the Mobile at Scale DevOps team with the primary purpose of providing the efficiencies and added value required to deliver large scale, multiyear mobile projects. It evolved over a period of time to a platform that provides a fully integrated technology stack for all delivery projects, whether bespoke application or at scale.

Boomerang Core is the core services of the IBM Automation Platform with Boomerang CICD and Boomerang Flow available as solutions.
