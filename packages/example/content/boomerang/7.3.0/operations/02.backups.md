# Backups

Backups are a required item for higher level environments such as User Acceptance Test (UAT) and Production. In our platform there is both Kubernetes<sup>®</sup> and Virtual Machine-based requirements, depending on the solution.

## Kubernetes

For Kubernetes based solutions, we are using VELERO<sup>®</sup> (formerly Heptio Ark), which provides the tools to back up and restore Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes.

VELERO will:
* Take backups of all or selected cluster resources and restore in case of loss
* Migrate cluster resources to other clusters
* Replicate your production cluster to development and testing clusters

VELERO consists of:
* A server that runs on your cluster
* A command-line client that runs locally

### Our implementation

For all the clusters being run and maintained internally by the Boomerang and IBM Automation Platform SRE teams, VELERO will be backing up to a centralized Minio in our Hub cluster which has a redundant disk backup. 

The schedule for this defaults to every 24 hours. For increased frequency, this needs to be identified and worked through on a case-by-case basis.

Backups are kept for 7 days unless otherwise requested.

## Virtual machines

Solution teams will need to provide backup scripts that will be scheduled by cron.
