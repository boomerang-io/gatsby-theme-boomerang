| AD001 | Oct 5, 2017 | twlawrie<br>gchickma | Microservice Configuration Architecture | Implement two types of environment-based configurations: <ol><li>Spring boot profile based with profile specific **application.properties**. This will handle live vs local which allows for running the service outside of a container locally or in another not Kubernetes<sup>®</sup> coupled implementation. </li><li>Implementation of Kubernetes-based configuration using environment properties mapped into the live spring boot profile and stored in config.yaml or passed in via Helm parameters. </li></ol> | <ul><li>[K8's Data Injection](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/)</li><li>[Spring Boot w K8's properties](https://github.com/fabric8io/spring-cloud-kubernetes#configmap-propertysource)</li><li>[Environment based config options](https://fabric8.io/guide/develop/configuration.html)</li><li>[IBM Example Code](https://github.com/IBM/spring-boot-microservices-on-kubernetes)</li></ul>
| AD002 | Oct 5, 2017 | twlawrie<br>gchickma | DNS-based internal referencing | When the custom UIs and services reference each other, they should use the internal service name (this is the name of the Kubernetes service) and port (internally exposed port, for example, 7707) to dynamically reference. This is based on kube-dns. |
| AD003 | Oct 9, 2017 | twlawrie<br>gchickma | Spring Boot JSON Library | The decision is to consolidate on the use of GSON and Jackson. To improve performance, use the default approach of GSON for smaller JSON files and Jackson for large JSON files. Although, depending on the service, it may be best to consolidate on just one library for the use case. Jackson is also used for the annotation support. | <ul><li>[Baeldung Jackson vs Gson](http://www.baeldung.com/jackson-vs-gson)</li></li>[The Ultimate Json Library](http://blog.takipi.com/the-ultimate-json-library-json-simple-vs-gson-vs-jackson-vs-json/)</li></ul> |
| AD006 | July 1, 2018 | twlawrie | API Gateway | For Release 1 of the platform, we use all the internal Kubernetes service discovery and open broker components. This handles essentially all of the service registry and discovery components. However, we will not have throttling or translation.<br><br>As we are not investing time in an API gateway middleware, the future direction is to go for a service mesh.| |
| AD007 | July 1, 2018 | twlwawrie | Browser Platform Support | We are currently supporting Chrome and Firefox<sup>®</sup>, with limited support for Safari<sup>®</sup>. We do not support any version of Internet Explorer<sup>®</sup> (IE). We typically support the current version and two previous versions. |
| AD008 | November 8, 2018 | cmoraru | Traffic to multiple Ingress Controllers | The cluster's URL pattern is `<cluster>.cloud.boomerangplatform.net/<team>/<env>/`. Heaving multiple Ingress Controllers exposed on different ports, the decision **not yet taken** is to use one of the following options: <ol><li>Expose the ports under which the multiple Ingress Controllers are deployed to end-users. </li><li>The current DNS design being `<cluster>.cloud.boomerangplatform.net/<team>/<env>/`, it should be able to support rerouting to a specific ingress controller. </li></ol><br> The decision is to use the second option, by provisioning an IBM WebSphere<sup>®</sup> Edge Load Balancer to forward the requests to a specific port.| <ul><li>[Link to diagram](./assets/img/edge-load-balancer-multiple-ingress-controller.png)</li></ul> |
| AD009 | March 7, 2018 | twlawrie | Data Encryption at Rest | The decision has been made as part of the Release 1 planning session to defer the implementation of data encryption at rest until Release 2 or a customer requirement. We have initial designs of this with GlusterFS and Kubernetes and will keep this requirement in mind with the implementation of all parts of the platform. However, it has not been enabled. |
| AD010 | August 5, 2019 | gchickma | Backups | Strategic decision is to leverage VELERO<sup>®</sup> (formerly Ark) and SoftLayer<sup>®</sup> S3 storage to manage backups. As VELERO requires ICP v3.2.2, the tactical in-place backup strategy will continue. Specifically, cron-scheduled exports from MongoDB and LDAP repositories with pushing of zipped exports to a backup folder on Boomerang Artifactory. |

## Legacy architectural decisions

The following are architectural decisions that have been made in the past, but may no longer be relevant. This allows us to keep a history of all those that have been made.

| AD004 | Oct 16, 2017 | twlawrie | IBM Cloud Private Port Definition | The decision is that the 31000 - 31999 port range will be for live and 32000 - 32999 will be for stage. Internally, the 000 - 099 range is for services with 100 - 199 for applications. Internally to the services and applications range, the first 50 are reserved for Boomerang. |  |
| AD005 | Dev 1, 2017 | twlawrie<br>gchickma | Classification of Boomerang users | Any user with email address ending in `*.ibm.com*` will be classified as internal to IBM (a current employee), and will be authenticated using W3id. All other users will be classified as external to IBM and will be authenticated using IBMid. |  |
