# Support

There are a number of areas and layers to the operations of the platform.

| Layer                   | Owner                  | Support Notes                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Solution / Application  | Development Squad      | Development squads will need rotational Software Reliability Engineers (SREs) to support investigation and coordinate fixes to the site.                                                                                         |
| Core                    | ISE                    | Core is used to operate and maintain the application platform and custom applications. The ISE operations team will perform all levels of support and be the initial contact point for requests. |
| IBM Cloud<sup>®</sup> Private (ICP) | Cloud / ISE            | Depends who owns this layer.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Virtual Machines        | Cloud (for example, SoftLayer<sup>®</sup>) | Cloud provider will support but tickets need to be raised against them.                                                                                                                          |
| Infrastructure          | Cloud (for example, SoftLayer) | Cloud provider will support but tickets need to be raised against them.                                                                                                                          |

## Support

As with all the layers mentioned in the above table, the first point of contact is designed to be the IBM Services Engineering (ISE) SRE team. If the support relates to a layer that is not directly owned by ISE, then a ticket would be raised and managed by this team against the owning team.

Resolution follows a product methodology and lifecycle.

> **Note**: Regardless of whether client assumes Level 1 support when on premise, the support team will still have a Level 1 layer to receive the tickets raised by a customer.

## Requests

The request types can be split into: enhancement and issues.

### Enhancement

Enhancements will come through from various sources, either as a feature needed to win work, or over time from customer solution teams.

Enhancement requests need to be reviewed by the Platform and Solution team architect review board.

Enhancements can be implemented through feature toggles or direct to code base. We never implement a forked version of the code base for a specific scenario.

### Issue

An issue can be triaged and evaluated for severity and potential fix category. If a previous fix has been found and is available in the support runbook, that can be followed.

If it requires a ticket to be raised against a dependent provider such as the IBM Cloud team, we will track to resolution.

If it requires a code fix, we will assign to the development squad for fix, test, version, and installation.

## Team

As the team grows, all members of the various squads will play a role in the support teams. This will include triage and resolution of issues. This ensures the team learns invaluable information as to how the customers are using the product but also provides basic knowledge sharing of the layers inside the platform.

| Role                          | Level     | Description                                                                                                                                             |

| First Responders / Operations | L1 & L1.5 | First to deal with ServiceNow<sup>®</sup> tickets and issues that occur.                                                                                             |
| SME / Solutions team          | L2 & L3   | For particular layers and solution components, for example, IAW or ACC.                                                                                           |
| SRE                           | L2 & L3   | ICP / Core / Some Middleware. We plan on having escalation paths in service now that go to PagerDuty and New Relic that feeds PagerDuty and ServiceNow. |
| AppOps                        | L2 & L3   | Infrastructure Issues                                                                                                                                   |
