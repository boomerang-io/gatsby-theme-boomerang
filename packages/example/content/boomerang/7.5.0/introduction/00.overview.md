# Overview

The IBM Services Essentials is your platform for accelerating continuous delivery with quality. The platform provides a modern flexible way to enable DevOps, and supports an Agile culture.

Delivery can be complex when the use or adoption of tools alone is not the solution. IBM Services Essentials bridges the gap between tools, and ties them together into a consistent and harmonized experience. It provides a common, centralized, and secure platform for all your tools, services, and applications. This approach accelerates development and delivery.

IBM Services Essentials is a multi-technology, hybrid cloud platform, tailored for IBM Services delivery. Bringing together the full DevOps lifecycle through one seamless platform, and backed by a hybrid, centralized, and distributed continuous integration system, we balance speed and flexibility with quality.

## Background

The platform was originally created by the Mobile at Scale DevOps team with the primary purpose of providing the efficiencies and added value required to deliver large scale, multiyear mobile projects. It evolved over a period of time to a platform that provides a fully integrated technology stack for all delivery projects, whether bespoke application or at scale.

Essentials Core is the center of services for the platform with Boomerang CICD and Boomerang Flow available as solutions.
