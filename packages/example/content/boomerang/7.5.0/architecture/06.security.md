# Security architecture

IBM Services Essentials provides Identity Provider support (IdP) as well as Identity, Access, and Entitlement Management (IAM), and audit services as part of the Core platform.

The platform supports a number of authentication protocols out of the box which can be configured as required.

## Authentication

- Single Sign-On (SSO) to the platform permits a user to access multiple solutions (applications) or services within the platform, while providing their credentials only once.
- Allows the applications, that are part of the platform, to authenticate users by validating user assertions, such as authentication tokens from the identity provider, without gaining access to a user's security credentials, such as a password.
- Provides pluggable authentication support.
- Provides support for standard protocols for federated authentication.
- Provides a mechanism for service-to-service authentication by segregating service accounts from user accounts.

Enterprises may have their own access management systems for federated authentication. In these cases, the platform only requires an authentication header to be present in every request.

### Authentication providers

### Two-factor authentication

The platform redirects, proxies and punches out to the specified authentication provider. In the case of two-factor authentication, this would be a feature that the provider would need to offer.

### Logout

The platform's `Sign out` functionality is being managed internally by the platform through the authentication proxy provider. The component responsible for the cookie creation (cookie with has the role to maintain the stateful information of the user) is also responsible for it's deletion.

## Authorization

- Authorization configuration is maintained centrally in the platform IAM component. The IAM component should allow configuring the source for retrieving authorization information.
- Configurable support for both role-based and attribute-based authorization.
- The IAM component should allow returning custom authorization attributes for each application.

**Authorization concepts**

| Concept              | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Platform Users       | Users of the platform                                       |
| Teams                | A group of platform users who have access to a set of tools   |
| Team Roles           | Roles at the team level                                      |
| Catalog              | A service that can be assigned to teams                     |
| Catalog Entitlements | Entitlements for access to a service                         |
| Service Tokens       | API Tokens to authorize and authenticate with Core services |

**Catalog services and entitlements**

Catalog services can be onboarded to the platform and assigned to teams to use. This is called their Catalog Entitlement. Users can be assigned a role for a service that is specific to their team. These are defined in the Catalog template.

Catalog services can have many attributes. More information can be read about this in the documentation for Boomerang Core.

**Roles**

## Service access tokens

For accessing certain API calls in the platform, a service token is required. Service tokens can be created from the [Boomerang Admin service tokens](https://launch.boomerangplatform.net/admin/tokens) screen.

![Boomerang Service Tokens](./assets/img/platform-access-token-creation.png)

Each service token is tied to a Catalog service that has been onboarded to the platform. After creating the service token, save it immediately locally for safe keeping. There is no mechanism for viewing it again.

This service token is used to call Essentials Core services, for example, the Boomerang Authorization and Identity Management service.

These services expect an HTTP header with the key `x-access-token` and value of the token that was provided on the platform's Admin application.

```shell
x-access-token: "644ab012-6884-473f-a2b3-d28537b7d2af"
```

This token is used to identify and verify applications that are accessing Essentials Core services.

Service Token Categories

| Concept  | Description                                                                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| core     | Access Essentials Core services such as the Authorization service.                |
| external | Protect REST end points with a token rather than using a verified user identity. |

## Platform authorization service

Every request that comes through the platform is identified and trusted. IBM Services Essentials provides authorization and role management features directly from the Admin management interface. Applications running on the platform are provided read-only access to these user role management APIs via the Authorization service. The Authorization API is an Essentials Core service, so clients need to include the `x-access-token` in requests to be correctly validated.

For example, retrieving user roles can be accessed via the /auth/users/roles endpoint.

`http://bmrg-core-services-auth/auth/users/roles?userEmail=mdroy@us.ibm.com`

```js
{
    "email": "mdroy@us.ibm.com",
    "name": "Marcus Roy",
    "tool": "Demo Apps Dev",
    "teams": [
        {
            "teamName": "Multi role 2",
            "userRoles": [
                "user",
                "tester"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Audit

The platform automatically logs all CRUD activities from Boomerang Core in an audit log that is kept for **90 days**. It logs user, time, method, and final object.

The Audit log can be viewed in the Admin interface by date, service, type and user.

## SSL certificates

The platform uses a Kubernetes<sup>®</sup> Certificate Manager integrated with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to automatically provide the SSL certificates used by our DNS entries.

## Data management

Data is mainly stored in the following locations:

- User Logs - ingested by Elastic
- System Logs - ingested by Elastic
- Redis - cache to temporarily store session information of the user
- RabbitMQ - message queue
- MongoDB<sup>®</sup> - application data
- MySQL<sup>®</sup> - application data
- PostreSQL - application data
- Persistent Volumes (PV) - application data
- Cloud Object Storage (COS) - application data, mass storage

The following table provides an overview of the data management profile:

### Data retention

- Data in backups is retained no longer than 30 days.
- User data is never deleted, however, it is sanitized of PI data via SHA256 as part of a user deletion request or off-boarding.

## Encryption

Encryption on the platform can be implemented at two distinct layers:

- Network or in-flight traffic can we encrypted through configuration of the Kubernetes networking layer and the exchange of SSL certificates.
- Data or at-rest components can be encrypted through configuration of the persistence volume layer and a passphrase.

### Data at-rest encryption

Encryption of stored or persisted data is established using GlusterFS<sup>®</sup> and dm-crypt. GlusterFS is the distribution file system manager and dm-crypt provides transparent encryption of block devices. In a similar fashion to network encryption, GlusterFS also leverages digital certificates for authentication.

Encryption can be implemented at the file system level, for example, on a directory or file, or at the volume level (the entire disk).

For further information on storage encryption see [IBM Cloud Private Encryption](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.1.1/installing/etcd.html)

At rest encryption can also be provided by the infrastructure hosting provider. Specifically, SoftLayer<sup>®</sup> provides encrypted iSCSI disk using Linux<sup>®</sup> Unified Key Setup (LUKS) or IBM General Parallel File System (GPFS).

SoftLayer provided Cloud Object Storage (COS) also supports data at rest encryption using automatic server-side Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit encryption and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)-256 hash.

### Data in-flight encryption

Network encryption using Kubernetes is established between each node or host via a secure IPSec tunnel. The IPSec tunnel uses Internet Key Exchange (IKE) for mutual authentication between each nodes in your cluster. For authentication, each node has a digital certificate that is signed by a trusted authority and a private key for that digital certificate. Node certificates and keys are generated during the installation of IBM Cloud<sup>®</sup> Private. The Calico pod running on each node also has IP over IP mode enabled (IP tunneling protocol that encapsulates one IP packet in another IP packet).

Networking within the cluster can be encrypted through the use of self-signed Kubernetes certificates generated during installation of IBM Cloud Private.

For further information on networking encryption see [IBM Cloud Private IPSec](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_3.1.1/installing/ipsec_mesh.html)

SoftLayer-provided Cloud Object Storage (COS) also supports data in flight encryption using built-in, carrier-grade Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL) encryption.

## Kubernetes policies

There are a number of policy types in Kubernetes<sup>®</sup> that help ensure security. We leverage a number of these.

### Pod security policy

Pod Security Policies (PSP) enable fine-grained authorization of pod creation and updates. They define a set of conditions that a pod must run with in order to be accepted into the system. From host access to Linux capabilities and privileges. See [Kubernetes Pod Security Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/) for more information.

We currently leverage the predefined [IBM Cloud Private pod security policies](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.1.1/manage_cluster/security.html). This allows us to leverage a maintained, defined set of standards for our solutions.

By default all pods run under `ibm-anyuid-psp`, however, the CICD Executor and Flow Workers run with privileged access under `ibm-privileged-psp`. The default PSP is assigned at the namespace level, with the CICD and Flow solutions taking care of creating the Kubernetes Service Accounts and Role Bindings to the elevated PSP at install time.

### Image policies

We leverage cluster-wide image policies with a list of approved containers that can be access.
