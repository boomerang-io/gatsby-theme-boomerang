# Overview

ACC is a vendor agnostic system (although the Release 1 primarily focuses upon Blue Prism) solution that allows business managers to monitor their hybrid workforces and automated business processes and understand current workloads and performance.

## Features

The first release of the Automation Control Centre (ACC) has been designed and built upon on research and feedback from clients across various industries. Automation Control Centre is a core component of the broader IBM Automation Platform.

The intent of the first release is to act as a baseline for iterative product development and as a proof point for technical feasibility. The front end is based on the Carbon Design System v9.
