# ACC DICTIONARY

## Business Process
| ACC |
|:-- |
|A business process or business method is a collection of related, structured activities or tasks by people or equipment which in a specific sequence produce a service or product (serves a particular business goal) for a particular customer or customers. Business processes occur at all organizational levels and may or may not be visible to the customers. A business process may often be visualized (modeled) as a flowchart of a sequence of activities with interleaving decision points or as a process matrix of a sequence of activities with relevance rules based on data in the process.| 

## Bot Process

| Process    | Bot                 | Process |

| ACC |
|:--|
| A bot process is the process representation as it has been created in the RPA technologies. A business process is mapped to one or multiple bot processes. | 



## Bot

| Blue Prism | Automation Anywhere | UIPath |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Resource – machines with BluePrism installed | Device – AA clients (runners or creators) that can create and/or run the process scripts. | Robot – any UIPath client that can connect to Orchestrator and are able to create/execute processes. |

| ACC |
|:--:|
Bot is the machine with RPA client able to run through a process (only the clients that include runtime, e.g. bot runners). A "Bot" is the VDI, the machine.

## Bot status "Broken"
| Blue Prism | Automation Anywhere | UIPath |
|:---|:---|:---|
| BluePrism in v 6 defines a bot status’ as a machine which cannot execute any processes. | Bot is ‘disconnected’ when a client’s service is down and/or the user is not logged in. | Bot is ‘Unresponsive’ when it cannot execute processes.|

| ACC |
|:--|
| A Bot is broken when it cannot be reached/cannot execute processes. |

## Bot "utilization"
| ACC |
|:-- |
| % of time the bot is in ‘Running’ mode vs total time |

## Bot "Execution Success Rate"
| ACC |
|:-- |
| % number of successful executions vs total number of executions |


## Process status "Broken"
| Blue Prism | Automation Anywhere | UIPath |
|:---|:---|:---|
| BluePrism has status of Stopped or Terminated, if the process execution has been manually stopped by a process. | AutomationAnywhere has an execution failed if it finishes with the following statuses: <li> FAILED (an exception has occurred) </li> <li>DEPLOY_FAILED (the bot cannot start the process execution, because it is disconnected) </li> <li> STOPPED (manually stopped by the user)</li> | UIPath defines the process as broken when the execution ends with any of the statuses: <ul> <li> STOPPED (manually stopped) </li> <li>FAULTED (ended with exception) </li>

| ACC |
|:-- |
|A process is broken in ACC if the latest execution has finished with status ‘stopped’ or ‘terminated’.|

## Process Activities
| Blue Prism | Automation Anywhere | UIPath |
|:---|:---|:---|
| BluePrism defines the atomic tasks as “stages” and the user has the possibility to set an appropriate business name for any stage performed and the option to log it or not. ACC will display from BP only the logged stages with the names defined by developers. | AA defines activities as ‘Commands’ and the information displayed is the technical step the process is currently executing, e.g. Mouse Click, Open Browser. | N/A |

| ACC |
| :-- |
| Process activities in ACC are the business process activities, as defined by the Business Process Model Notation standard. So, a BPMN Activity is simply "Work" that a company or organization performs in a business process. An Activity is can be atomic (Tasks) or decomposable (Sub-Processes). A BPMN task is an atomic activity within a process flow. You create a task when the activity cannot be broken down to a finer level of detail. Generally, a person or applications will perform the task when it is executed. |

## Execution Responsiveness
| Blue Prism | Automation Anywhere | UIPath |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Time spent in Pending state, until a user manually starts the process. | Time spent in Deployed state, until the bot is available to start running the process (without user intervention). | Time spent in Deployed state, until the bot is available to start running the process (without user intervention) |

| ACC |
| :-- |
|Average time in queue for all executions in the past 24 hours. |

## Execution Duration
| Blue Prism | Automation Anywhere | UIPath |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Time since the process has started the execution in Pending state, until it is completed or stopped by the user. | Time since the process has started the execution in Deployed state, until it is completed or stopped by the user. | Time since the process has started the execution in Pending state, until it is completed or stopped by the user. |

| ACC |
| :-- |
| Time since the process has started the execution in Pending state, until it is completed or stopped by the user. |

## Lazy Bot
| ACC |
| :-- |
|Lazy Bot is a bot with low utilization rate throughout the day, who either is incapable of executing other type of processes or either spends a suspiciously large amount of time executing some specific processes.|

## Planned Exception
| ACC |
| :-- |
| During an execution, the bot has a branch of logic to handle an execution by throwing a “planned exception” - the bot cannot work on the execution anymore and must hand off to a human. Example: “business logic”. |

## Unplanned Exception
| ACC |
| :-- |
| During an execution, the bot runs into an issue that it does not know how to handle, it cannot continue the execution and doesn’t know what to do - maybe it’s stuck in a loop. This will throw an “unplanned exception” and the execution will be handled by a human. Example: “data or technical issue”|

## Lazy Load
| ACC |
| :-- |
| Defines the behaviour for tables that contains a lot of data and chunks (usually 20 rows) should be loaded as the user scrolls at the bottom of the page or table; operation should repeat until there is no more data to load. |

## Cost of operation
| ACC |
| :-- |
| This information is related to the companies that provide hosting for the VDIs of the client. Usually formed from different dimensions such as: Licenses, Operating system licenses, Database licenses, Labor support, etc. At the time there is only one dimensions that includes all, and that is “hosting” that can be: Hourly, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly.|

## Execution
| ACC |
| :-- |
| An execution represents the operation of execution done by one or more bots on a process. Consists on a series of activities that are executed based on the rules described by the process, with or without human intervention. |

## Bot Maintenance
| ACC |
| :-- |
| Defines the operation of reporting that a bot will be functioning between the reported times. This operation does not limit any RPA or BPM system from taking any actions, such as: starting, stopping, pausing, etc. the process execution by the respective bot. |

## Bot flagging
| ACC |
| :-- |
| Defines the operation of opening a ticket, into the ticketing system, by reporting a specific type of issues from a known list of items. Thus moving the bot for further examination by specialised technicians. |

## Process workforce
| ACC |
| :-- |
| The sum of all the bots or humans that have to execute or approve the activities of the process.|

## Human intervention
| ACC |
| :-- |
| Intervention  / Human intervention - is the representation of a human operation needed into the process execution so that execution can be finalised or moved to the next activity. Usually an approval on some else behalf. |
