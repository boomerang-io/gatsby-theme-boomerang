# Editor

The editor is where the magic happens for creating and managing workflows. You define everything to do with your workflow including designing the model, triggers, options, and properties.

The editor is an advanced visual drag and drop no code workflow editor. 

## Features

- Drag and Drop
- Dynamic property resolution
- Conditional switches
- Link state logic
- Triggers
- Persistent Storage
- Parallelism

## Settings

The settings tab of the Editor is where you configure all the general metadata about the workflow, the triggers, and any advanced options.

![Editor Overview](./assets/img/designer-settings.png)

### General info

- Identify the owning team of the workflow
- Set the unique name of the workflow
- Set a summary or short description. _This shows up on the workflows and execution cards_
- Enter a description
- Select from pre-defined icons

### Triggers

There are multiple trigger types;

- Manual. Always enabled and can be triggered from the workflows screen.
- Webhook. Requires a token to be provided in the payload of the webhook request along with any required inputs.
- Schedule. A schedule is based on cron syntax and by specifying a timezone. Any required inputs must have a default value set as this will be used at running time.
- Action Listener. A NATS stream to subscribe to. You can optionally choose to send data to ACC.

### Other Options

Enable persistent storage for the duration of the workflow. This allows you to share items between tasks in the workflow during execution i.e. downloading some files and performing an action on those files.

By enabling persistent storage, you will have a data drive (`/data`). Write the output from a task to that folder and you will be able to access that file from a subsequent task.

## Editor

The editor is the drag and drop interface for laying out a workflow. A workflow is a series of connected tasks laid out left to right with the links between tasks. These links are what help define the direct acyclic graph (dag) and associated execution order.

The following describes the unique features offered by Flow that help in creating a workflow and determine execution.

### Palette

On the left hand side is the palette. This is where you will find all the tasks, grouped by category, that can be dragged onto a workflow and initialized.

### Links

![Links](./assets/img/designer-links.gif)

Links are drawn from the out node on each task, each with a delete action.

Standard links have a state feature; always run, success, and failure. This is a simple but effective way of determining whether the status of a task is important. You can ask yourself "Is it ok for this task to fail?" or "Do I want a particular action to occur based on state?". For example you could have a subsequent task to raise an alert to be actioned if an important task fails.

Switch links have no state, instead they have a condition value and are shown by a pencil icon. More on this in Switches.

### Switches

![Switches](./assets/img/designer-switches.gif)

Switches are a predefined utility allowing for simple decision based on the value of the input. When you add a switch you can simple set a string value or reference a property for dynamic switches based on inputs at execution time.

Links from switches are unique as the link has a value instead of a state. The link will be set to `default` meaning the path taken when no others are matched. To set a value on a switch link click the pencil icon and toggle default to false.

Switch links allow for multiple values to be entered, one per line. Only one must match for this connection to be valid. It can be a plain string or regular expression.

### Tasks

Tasks are individually executed containers and as such can do anything from simple actions to complex integrations.

Each instantiated task must have a unique name in the workflow (i.e. two tasks cannot have the same name in the same workflow) and can take inputs. The input fields can accept properties such as a previous tasks output property or a workflow property.

See [Tasks](tasks) for more detail.


## Properties

The properties tab provides the capabilities to create, edit, and delete input properties for the workflow. Input keys are restricted to Numbers, Letters and a `.` for example the following are valid; `valid.key` and `Valid.kEY.123`, however the following are invalid `invalid-key` and `invalid&%#key`

![Editor Inputs](./assets/img/designer-properties.png)

An input property can be of different types and the screen will update dynamically to help you craft the desired values and defaults.

| Input Type | Description                                                                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Boolean    | Allows for a true / false switch.                                                |
| Number     | Allows for integer input                                                         |
| Password   | A secure input field. _Note: In beta 1 the property will be visible in the logs_ |
| Select     | Defined options that can be selected by the user                                 |
| Text       | Single line text input                                                           |
| Text Area  | Multi line text input                                                            |

Properties can be set for many different parts of the application and are available throughout a workflow or task and are subsituted at execution time.

Please note the dependencies based on trigger type. Properties will render as per their type when manually executing a workflow, however webhook and schedule have particular requirements. See above section on triggers.

See [Properties](properties) for more detail.

## Change Log and Versioning

The editor has inbuilt versioning and change log functionality. Every time a user creates a new version of the workflow a prompt will appear asking for a comment on the version. This can then be viewed in the Change Log tab to keep a record of all changes.

Any version can be rolled back to at any time using the controls on the upper right of the Design tab.

## Task Icon Naming Conventions

The icons associated with tasks in Editor are paired via a key word system displayed in the table below. If the prefix is found at the beginning of the task name, then the associated Icon in the table will appear with the Task. There are also special cases specified in the table where the prefix can be anywhere in the task name. If the task name does not map with any of the listed prefixes, then the default task icon will be used.

| Prefix    | Needs to be first word | Image Name         | Icon                                                   |
