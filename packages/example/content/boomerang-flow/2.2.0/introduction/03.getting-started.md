# Getting started

Boomerang Flow integrates with your Boomerang teams. Ensure you have access to a team or create a new team and request access to Boomerang Flow.

## Create Workflows

Once you have access, you can open from Boomerang Core Launchpad and start creating new workflows straight away.

## Need Help?

Anywhere from within the app, you can select the `?` in the top right hand corner to enable contextual help.

Still stuck? Try posting in the `bmrg-flow-users` channel. Someone from the development team can help resolve your issue. 

## Optimal Browser Support

Flow is optimized from Chrome. If you are experiencing issues with another browser, please revert to Chrome and try again.
