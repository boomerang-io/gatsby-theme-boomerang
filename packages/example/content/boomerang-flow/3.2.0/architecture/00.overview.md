# Architecture Overview

![Architecture](./assets/img/boomerang-flow-architecture-components.png)

The Boomerang Flow application has the following main components, navigate to the [Application Architecture](/boomerang-flow/architecture/application) to learn more.

- **Front End application**: This is the end user visual designer, enabling no-code workflow building, as well as the ability to see manage all aspects of your workflows, including activity and insights.
- **Back End microservice**: This component translates the requests from the Front End application and other trigger interactions to an agnostic Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) model.
- **Kubernetes controller**: This controller integrates with Kubernetes<sup>®</sup> to perform and manage executions.
- **Task workers**: The Task workers are containers used to execute the tasks mapped in the workflow.

## Tasks

Boomerang Flow supports a number of different types of tasks including providing pre-built tasks designed for a no-code experience. These are single-focus tasks that offer tight integration into the platform with certified tasks providing a guaranteed implementation and tested experience.

## Custom Tasks and Lifecycle Watcher

![Architecture](./assets/img/boomerang-flow-architecture-customtask.png)

The custom task is a special type of System Task where you can bring your own container and run that as a task. Typically the Custom task has no knowledge or understanding of integrating with Boomerang Flow and we do not force adherence to a specific implementation. The Custom task is denoted by a flag in the upper left corner of the task in the workflow Editor and workflow Run pages.

As such, the Custom task is essentially a bring-your-own container paradigm which Boomerang Flow then wraps with its own lifecycle implementation via init-containers and sidecars. However this same implementation is available to Template Tasks and can be enabled in the Task definition.

The controller will orchestrate this lifecycle in conjunction with ensuring the normal criteria.

### Init lifecycle

The Init lifecycle is implemented as an init-container and ensures that the prestart requirements are met. This includes creating a lock file and any other dependencies that are needed.

### Watcher lifecycle

The Watcher lifecycle is implemented as a sidecar container. This container waits for the Custom Task (or Task) container to complete and then executes the termination activities. This includes setting result parameters.

The Watcher and the Custom task containers are linked through a Kubernetes<sup>®</sup> `emptyDir` mounted to the `/lifecycle` path.
