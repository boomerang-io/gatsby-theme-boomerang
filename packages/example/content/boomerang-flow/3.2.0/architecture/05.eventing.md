# Eventing architecture

Boomerang Flow supports events through an eventing implementation based on CloudEvents and HTTPS/NATS. You can also optionally choose to extend this with other eventing systems, like Azure Event Grid and KNative eventing, for example.

In turn, these events are used as triggers (based on Workflow triggers) to invoke a workflow, or to interact with an in-flight workflow, through the **Wait for Event** task.

## Endpoints

### Webhook

The webhook endpoint will accept a generic webhook style event with query parameters. 

```
POST /listener/webhook?workflowId={id}&type={generic|slack|dockerhub}
```

**Consumes**
- `application/json`

**Query Parameters**

| Name |	Description	|
| --- | --- |
| `workflowId` | The ID of the workflow you wish to trigger. |
| `type` | The type of webhook to trigger. By default, the type is generic. However, we also support special cases with Docker Hub<sup>®</sup> and Slack<sup>®</sup>, with the aim to offer support for GitHub<sup>®</sup>, GitLab<sup>®</sup>, PagerDuty<sup>®</sup>, and ServiceNow<sup>®</sup>. This allows us to implement specific functionality, such as responding to the Slack verification request or the Docker Hub callback URL. |
| `token` | The access token can be provided as a query parameter or provided in the Authorization header. See the [Security Architecture](/boomerang-flow/architecture/security) to know more. |

**Payload**

Any body passed in as part of the payload will be available as a Workflow Parameter. See below section on [Payload and Parameters](#payload-and-parameters).

### Wait For Event

There is a special case of webhook reserved for the **Wait For Event** task as part of an executing workflow. 

> **Note:** This does not trigger a workflow. This only completes a task as part of the workflow execution.

```
POST /listener/webhook/wfe?workflowId={id}&workflowActivityId={id2}&topic={topic}&status={status}

GET /listener/webhook/wfe?workflowId={id}&workflowActivityId={id2}&topic={topic}&status={status}
```

**Consumes**
- `application/json`

**Query Parameters**

| Name |	Description	|
| --- | --- |
| `workflowId` | The ID of the workflow. |
| `workflowActivityId` | The ID of the particular workflow activity. |
| `topic` | The topic set on the particular **Wait For Event** task in your workflow. |
| `status` | *(Optional)* The status for the task you want set and allows you to use the link states when connecting from the task to another task. This defaults to "success" however you can set "failure". |
| `token` | The access token can be provided as a query parameter or provided in the Authorization header. See the [Security Architecture](/boomerang-flow/architecture/security) to know more. |

**Payload**

Any body passed in as part of the payload will be available as a Task Result Parameter. See below section on [Payload and Parameters](#payload-and-parameters).

The payload is only available to be processed when using the `POST`

### Event

This endpoint accepts a full CloudEvent either in the JSON body or between the headers and the body. See below section on [CloudEvents Specification](#cloudevents-specification).

This accepts any of the webhook types, a **Wait For Event**, or a custom event.

```
PUT /listener/event
```

**Sample Custom Event Payload**

| CloudEvents Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Type | `io.boomerang.eventing.custom` | 
| Subject | `/<workflowId>/<topic>` | 

```json
{
    "specversion" : "1.0",
    "type" : "io.boomerang.eventing.custom",
    "subject" : "/5f7e2c8969f04975a0fff357/hello",
    "source": "/origin",
    "id" : "C234-1234-1234",
    "time" : "2018-04-05T17:31:00Z",
    "datacontenttype" : "application/json",
    "data" : {
      "images": [
        "645e2bc24c223dc1cc3",
        "10196e304f6634cc582"
      ],
      "pushed_at": 1.417566161e+09,
      "pusher": "trustedbuilder",
      "tag": "latest"
    }
}
```

**Sample Webhook Event Payload**

| CloudEvents Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Type | `io.boomerang.eventing.webhook` | 
| Subject | `/<workflowId>` | 

```json
{
    "specversion" : "1.0",
    "type" : "io.boomerang.eventing.custom",
    "subject" : "/5f7e2c8969f04975a0fff357/hello",
    "source": "/origin",
    "id" : "C234-1234-1234",
    "time" : "2018-04-05T17:31:00Z",
    "datacontenttype" : "application/json",
    "data" : {
      "foo": "bar"
    }
}
```

**Sample Wait For Event Payload**

| CloudEvents Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Type | `io.boomerang.eventing.wfe` | 
| Subject | `/<workflowId>/<workflowActivityId>/<topic>` | 

| CloudEvents Extension | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | `success|failure` | 

```json
{
    "specversion" : "1.0",
    "type" : "io.boomerang.eventing.wfe",
    "subject" : "/5f7e2c8969f04975a0fff357/6010b41bbadf2e7743e03324/hello",
    "source": "/origin",
    "id" : "C234-1234-1234",
    "time" : "2018-04-05T17:31:00Z",
    "status" : "success",
    "datacontenttype" : "application/json",
    "data" : {
      "hello": "world" 
    }
}
```

## CloudEvents Specification

The [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/) specification allows for an industry wide accepted implementation. See the specifications [published here](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec).

We are currently using v1.0 of the specification, along with the HTTP, JSON, and NATS protocol bindings.

### Data attribute

The payload of the body is mapped to the CloudEvents data attribute, and in turn is available as parameters in the workflow. See below [Payload and Parameters](#payload-and-parameters) for more details.

### Type attribute
The CloudEvents type is based on the webhook type and prefixed with `io.boomerang.eventing.`, for example, to become `io.boomerang.eventing.webhook` or `io.boomerang.eventing.wfe` or `io.boomerang.eventing.custom`

### Subject attribute

The workflow ID is passed in as the CloudEvents subject as `/<workflowId>` with an optional `/<topic>` to become `/<workflowId>/<topic>`

## Payload and Parameters

There are two ways for retrieving parameters from the event payload.

**Workflow Parameter JSON Path**

Workflow input parameters allow a `JsonPath` to be set for mapping values in the event payload when an event triggers a workflow. 

For example, if the above sample event payload was received, and you had a workflow input parameter with `JsonPath` of `push_data.tag`, then it would get a value as part of the execution of `latest`. You could also have an input parameter with a `JsonPath` of `push_data.images[2]`, which would map to the value of `51a9c7c1f8bb2fa19bcd09789a34e63f35abb80044bc10196e304f6634cc582c` at workflow execution.

**Workflow Payload Parameter**

The entire CloudEvent data attribute becomes a workflow input parameter called `eventPayload` that you can access in your workflow.

**Wait For Event Result Payload Parameter**

The entire CloudEvent data attribute becomes a task result parameter called `eventPayload` that you can access in otehr tasks following the result parameter reference.
