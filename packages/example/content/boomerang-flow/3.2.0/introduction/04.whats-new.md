## Workflows

- Added the ability to specify custom labels to a Workflow. This can help you find multiple Workflows that are related or for operating purposes as they are also added to the objects in Kubernetes

## Tasks

- Tasks are now aligned with Tekton tasks with the ability to import, export, and edit using the Tekton task definition
  - Boomerang Flow adds additional metadata following Kubernetes practice through annotations that help store information needed for the user experience.
- Updated the following task names for Parameter reference:
  - Read Parameters to File file utilities task
  - Read File to Parameter file utilities task
  - Set Output Parameter system task
