# Getting started

## Team Creation

### Standalone

Teams need to be created by a user with Administrator rights and can then map users to a team.

### IBM Services Essentials

When integrated with IBM Services Essentials, Boomerang Flow integrates with your Boomerang teams. Ensure you have access to a team or create a new team and request access to Boomerang Flow.

## Create workflows

Once you have access and a team, you can start creating new workflows using the **Create a new workflow** tile on the Workflows screen.

This will open a modal allow you to **Start from scratch** or **Import a workflow**.

## Need help?

Select **?** in the top right corner of any page in the application to enable contextual help.

Still stuck? Try posting in the bmrg-flow-users channel. Someone from the development team can help resolve your issue. 

## Optimal browser support

Flow is optimized from Chrome. If you are experiencing issues with another browser, please revert to Chrome and try again.
