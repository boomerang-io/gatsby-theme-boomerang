# Eventing architecture

Boomerang Flow supports events through an eventing implementation based on CloudEvents and HTTPS/NATS. You can also optionally choose to extend this with other eventing systems, like Azure Event Grid and KNative eventing, for example.

In turn, these events are used as triggers (based on Workflow triggers) to invoke a workflow, or to interact with an in-flight workflow, through the **Wait for Event** task.

## Listening

The Listener service accepts two different types of events: webhook and JSON CloudEvent. Both of these are based on the CloudEvents specification mentioned below.

### Webhook

The webhook endpoint will accept a generic webhook style event with query parameters: workflow Id, the type of webhook, and access token. The access token can be provided as a query parameter provided in the Authorization header. See the [Security Architecture](/boomerang-flow/architecture/security-architecture) to know more.

By default, the type is generic. However, we also support special cases with Docker Hub<sup>®</sup> and Slack<sup>®</sup>, with the aim to offer support for GitHub<sup>®</sup>, GitLab<sup>®</sup>, PagerDuty<sup>®</sup>, and ServiceNow<sup>®</sup>. This allows us to implement specific functionality, such as responding to the Slack verification request or the Docker Hub callback URL.

URL: `/listener/webhook?workflowId={id}&type={generic|slack|dockerhub}`

**Wait For Event**

There is a special case of webhook reserved for the **Wait For Event** task as part of an executing workflow. This accepts additional query parameters of `workflowActivityId` and `topic`, but not the type to become `/listener/webhook/wfe?workflowId={id}&workflowActivityId={id2}&topic={topic}`.

This is automatically generated for you as part of the **Wait For Event** task.

### Cloud Event structure

The payload of the body is mapped to the CloudEvent data attribute, and in turn is available as properties in the workflow. See below [Payload and Properties](#payload-and-properties) for more details.

The CloudEvent type is based on the webhook type and prefixed with `io.boomerang.eventing.`, for example, to become `io.boomerang.eventing.webhook`

The workflow ID is passed in as the CloudEvent subject as `/workflowId`

### Event

The `/listener/event` endpoint accepts a full CloudEvent either in the JSON body or between the headers and the body. The following details are needed for the event to be mapped and understand:

| CloudEvent Attribute | Value | 
| --- | --- |
| Type | `io.boomerang.eventing.custom` |
| Subject | `/workflowId/topic` |

**Sample Event Payload**

```json
{
    "specversion" : "1.0",
    "type" : "io.boomerang.eventing.custom",
    "source" : "/5f7e2c8969f04975a0fff357/hello",
    "id" : "C234-1234-1234",
    "time" : "2018-04-05T17:31:00Z",
    "datacontenttype" : "application/json",
    "data" : {
      "push_data": {
        "images": [
            "27d47432a69bca5f2700e4dff7de0388ed65f9d3fb1ec645e2bc24c223dc1cc3",
            "51a9c7c1f8bb2fa19bcd09789a34e63f35abb80044bc10196e304f6634cc582c"
        ],
        "pushed_at": 1.417566161e+09,
        "pusher": "trustedbuilder",
        "tag": "latest"
      }
    }
}
```

## Payload and Properties

There are two ways for retrieving properties from the event payload.

**Workflow input property JSON Path**

Workflow input properties allow a `JsonPath` to be set for mapping values in the event payload when an event triggers a workflow. 

For example, if the above sample event payload was received, and you had a workflow input property with `JsonPath` of `push_data.tag`, then it would get a value as part of the execution of `latest`. You could also have an input property with a `JsonPath` of `push_data.images[2]`, which would map to the value of `51a9c7c1f8bb2fa19bcd09789a34e63f35abb80044bc10196e304f6634cc582c` at workflow execution.

**Workflow Input Property Payload Property**

The entire CloudEvent data element becomes a workflow input property called `io.boomerang.eventing.data` that you can access in your workflow.

## Events Specification

The [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/) specification allows for an industry wide accepted implementation. See the specifications [published here](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec).

We are currently using v1.0 of the specification, along with the HTTP, JSON, and NATS protocol bindings.
