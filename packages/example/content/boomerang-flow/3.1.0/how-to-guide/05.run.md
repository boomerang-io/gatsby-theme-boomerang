# Execute

To manually execute a workflow, click **Run It** on the workflow tile. 

An Execute Workflow modal displays with two options. You can **Run** the workflow and remain on the current Workflows page, or **Run and View** the workflow, which takes you through to the detailed Activity Run screen, where you can view the workflow progress.
