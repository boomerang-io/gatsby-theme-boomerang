# Integrations

Workflows can be triggered via the Flow UI by running the workflow from the work flows screen.

Flow also offers additional trigger types that can be configured as part of Workflow settings.

* Webhook
* Scheduling
* Action Listener

## Webhook

After enabling the Webhook Trigger, you will receive a workflow specific access token, then can be used to invoke the latest revision of your workflow programmatically with the following exposed endpoints.

### Triggering workflow

#### Request

POST http://{flow.service.webhook}/webhook/payload

```json
{
	"token" : "<Webhook API Token Here>"
}
```

#### Response

After the submission, you will receive an activityId, and this can be used to request the status of the workflow execution.

```json
{
    "activityId": "5de81b5fe638b70001fa9d09"
}
```

### Execution Status

#### Request

GET http://{flow.service.webhook}/webhook/status/{activityId}


```json
{
	"token" : "<Webhook API Token Here>"
}
```

#### Response

The response for execution status will contain the overall execution status, break down of individual tasks, including the output properties of each task if they exist.
