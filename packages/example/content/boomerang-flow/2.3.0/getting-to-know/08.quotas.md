# Quotas

At the point of team creation. A team will be given a default quota set that defines:

- Number of Workflows that can be created for this team.
- Number of executions per month across all Workflows for a team
- Persistent storage size limit per Workflow
- Max number of Workflows able to run at the same time

Quotas are set by the administrator. If you have a concern about your allotted amounts, contact an admin.
