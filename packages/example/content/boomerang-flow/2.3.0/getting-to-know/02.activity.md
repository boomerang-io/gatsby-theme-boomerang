# Activity

Activity allows you to view each individual execution of a workflow. Each time you execute a workflow, an activity is associated with this execution and the system keeps information on workflow status, workflow duration, task status, task duration, output properties, and logs.

## Overview

The Activity screen provides you with a snapshot breakdown and the ability to filter by:
- status
- team
- workflow
- trigger method
- date range

Additional information of start time and duration will be displayed along with visual markers to match the status. In Progress will pulsate through a range of the status colors.

By clicking on an individual activity card you will be taken to the activity execution detail.

## Activity Run

The activity execution detail is a read-only view of your workflow design with visual indication of both the status of each task but also the link state.

On the top you have the workflow metadata

On the left you are provided with a panel with the workflow status and duration and a breakdown of each task that was executed.

It is in this task breakdown that you can access the logs and output properties
