![Boomerang Infrastructure Architecture](./assets/img/Boomerang-Architecture-Application-Flow-2.0.png)

**Dependencies**

The following platform wide dependencies are prior to, and in addition to, any dependencies for Boomerang Core.

| Dependency | Implementation | Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Kubernetes | IBM Cloud Private (3.2.1+) or Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (4.2+) | 1.13.9+ | | 
| Application Load Balancer | NGINX | 0.23.0 | |
| Certificate Manager | Jetstack Cert Manager | 0.7.0 | If using IBM ICP 3.1.1 or higher, we can use the provided IBM Cert Manager which is a forked implementation. |
| Logs | Elasticsearch | 5.5.1 |  |
| Monitoring | New Relic Infrastructure, New Relic Kubernetes, New Relic APM Agent | 4.10.0 | _if enabled_ |
| Tracing | Jaeger | | _if enabled_ |

## Flow

Flow is the Cloud Native workflow automation engine. Currently in beta.

| Component | Type         | Technology         | Internal to Internal | External Ingress | Internal Dependency | External Dependency | Optional Side Cars |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Flow      | Front End    | React + Node.js    | Flow MS            | true             |                     |                     |                    |
| Flow      | Microservice | Spring Boot (Java) | Controller MS      | true             | MongoDB             |                     | New Relic APM      |
| Controller| Microservice | Spring Boot (Java) |                    | false            | Kubernetes          |                     | New Relic APM      |
| Webhook   | Microservice | Spring Boot (Java) | Flow MS            | true             |                     |                     | New Relic APM      |
| Worker    | Job          | Node.js CLI        |                    | false            | Kubernetes          |                     |                    |
| Lifecycle Worker | Orchestration          | Node.js CLI        |                    | false            | Kubernetes          |                     |                    |

_Notes:_

1. The worker is dynamically spun up based on the workflows being executed.
2. Kubernetes is required with access to ConfigMaps, PersistentVolumes, and Jobs.
3. Has an integration to the platforms Action Listener
4. The workers have implemented, and are bound to, specific RBAC priviledges in Kubernetes.

**Dependencies:**

| Dependency       | Implementation                   | Version |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | ------- |
| Kubernetes       | IBM Cloud Private                | 3.2.1   |

## Action Listener

Currently implemented as an extension to Flow utilizing an Open-source, cloud-native messaging system. Currently in alpha.

| Component | Type         | Technology         | Internal to Internal | External Ingress | Internal Dependency | External Dependency | Optional Side Cars |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| HTTP Listener      | Microservice | Spring Boot (Java) |       | true             | NATS            |                     | New Relic APM      |
