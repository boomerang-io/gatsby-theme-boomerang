# Service Standards

This is a living document of the standards and best practices used by the IBM Services Engineering team for service development. Our services are developed using the latest tools and libraries in the Spring ecosystem leveraging the latest features of the Java language.

## Cloud Native

The IBM Services Engineering team follows cloud native practices for developing and running applications. Please see [What is cloud native?](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cloud-native/overview.html#overview) for more information.

### Health Checks

Health checks are an important mechanism for determining if a service is available in automated systems. Please see [Health checking](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cloud-native/topic-healthcheck.html#healthcheck) for a detailed explanation of their purpose.

Java

- JAX-RS - [Health checks with JAX-RS](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/java/microprofile-healthcheck.html#jaxrs-healthcheck)
- Spring - [Health checks with Spring](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/java/spring-healthcheck.html#spring-healthcheck)

Sample Spring Boot 2.0 properties configuration for end point:

```
management.endpoints.web.base-path=/
management.endpoints.enabled-by-default=false
management.endpoint.info.enabled=true
management.endpoint.health.enabled=true
```

Sample Spring Boot 1.5.x properties configuration for health end point:

```
endpoints.enabled=false
endpoints.info.enabled=true
endpoints.health.enabled=true
```

## Java

Microservices are to be developed using Spring Boot 2.0.

### Architecture Best Practices

We follow cloud native practices for our Java services. Please see [Programming with Java on IBM Cloud](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/java/overview.html#overview) for more information.

### Project Structure

The Java project should respect the maven structure:

https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html

As a new spring boot based micro services project the following project should be used to kick start:

https://github.ibm.com/Boomerang/boomerang.service.helloworld

For new projects the stucture can be generate using the maven archetype plugin:

```
mvn archetype:generate
	-DgroupId={project-packaging}
	-DartifactId={project-name}
	-DinteractiveMode=false
```

The project should contain the **README.md** file, which contain a set of useful information about the project, a kind of manual.

The project should contain the **.gitignore** file, which should be generate for new project using the following link:

https://www.gitignore.io/api/git,osx,java,maven,macos,eclipse,netbeans,java-web,intellij,code-java,visualstudiocode

The project should contain the **Dockerfile**. A Docker image consists of read-only layers each of which represents a Dockerfile instruction. The layers are stacked and each one is a delta of the changes from the previous layer. For maven project the best practice is to separate the maven build from checkout he dependencies:

```
COPY pom.xml .
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline

COPY . .
RUN mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dversion.name=$BMRG_TAG
```

### Development Tools

#### Spring Tools 4

The spring-boot-devtools module has been included in each project as a Maven dependency to provide additional development-time features. This includes hot reloading of the Spring Boot when it notices changed have been made in your project.

https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-devtools.html

It is recommended that developers leverage the Spring Tools plugins for their preferred IDE. For Eclipse it can be added from the marketplace or downloaded as a standard eclipse bundle with the Spring Tools Suite. Alternatively, plugins are available for Visual Studio Code and Atom available at [Spring Tool Suite)[https://spring.io/tools].

This tool provides a dashboard to launch and stop Spring Boot Applications, set the default spring boot profile when running and provides additional static code analysis checks in the UI that are specific to Spring such as checking for malformed Spring Data queries that been defined in a Java interface.

### Coding standards

We follow the Google Java style guide for our Java services. Please see [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) for more information.

#### Code Quality

##### SonarQube

SonarQube is used as a quality gate for executing static code analysis scans for every single build. Results can be viewed on [SonarQube](https://tools.boomerangplatform.net/sonarqube/projects) after your microservice has been built and tested.

To assist with resolving issues, you can make sure of SonarLint which is an IDE plugin for Eclipse/Visual Studio Code/Atom & IntelliJ.

For Eclipse, SonarLint can be downloaded from the Eclipse market place, by navigating to Help -> Eclipse Marketplace, and searching for "SonarLint"

From with inside eclipse, you can connect a project to https://tools.boomerangplatform.net/sonarqube to allow you to view results of a static code analysis scan from within your IDE. Open the SonarLint binding view inside eclipse, right click and add a new server configuration. When prompted provide the SonarQube URL https://tools.boomerangplatform.net/sonarqube, UserName/Password or Auth Token.

Next right click on your server and select bind projects, this will allow you to correctly link your local eclipse workspace projects with projects hosted on the SonarQube server to allow you to run static code analysis tests with the same rules and allow a quicker fix/test development cycle to fix all issues.

#### Code Formatting for Eclipse

Download the eclipse-java-google-style.xml file from the http://code.google.com/p/google-styleguide/ repo. In eclipse under Window/Preferences select Java/Code Style/Formatter. Import the settings file by selecting Import.

#### Code Formatting for Visual Studio Code

If you are making use of the Language support For Java VS Code extension, you can configure the inbuilt formatter using the same eclipse formatter provided by Google that implements the Java google style guide.

Set the following property:

```
"java.format.settings.url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/styleguide/gh-pages/eclipse-java-google-style.xml"
```

### Integrate service with Opentracing

The boomerang.lib.opentracing provide a Spring configuration which enable the opentracing integration with Jaeger.

#### Prerequisites:

1. Java 1.8
2. Springboot 1.5.x
3. Maven
4. Jaeger service

#### Configuration:

1. Configure the service pom.xml:

_Project dependency_

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.boomerangplatform</groupId>
    <artifactId>lib-opentracing</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

_Spring dependecies in order to use the project spring version_

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-web</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-core</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-context</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

2. Configure application.properties file to use the opentracing:

```
#Property to enable/disable collecting data
opentracing.jaeger.enabled=true
#The service name used by jaeger.
opentracing.jaeger.service-name=boomerang

#The hostname for communicating with agent via UDP
opentracing.jaeger.udp-sender.host=localhost
#The port for communicating with agent via UDP
opentracing.jaeger.udp-sender.port=6831

#The traces endpoint, in case the client should connect directly to the Collector
opentracing.jaeger.http-sender.url=http://localhost:14268/api/traces
#Defines the address of HTTP server that services client configuration, such as sampling strategies, baggage restrictions, throttling config, etc. The variable name is a legacy misnomer from the time when the server only provided the sampling strategies. At the moment only jaeger-agent implements this REST API.
opentracing.jaeger.remote-controlled-sampler.host-port=localhost:5778

#The sampler type. Values possible: const, probabilistic, ratelimiting, remote
opentracing.jaeger.sampler-type=probabilistic
#The sampler parameter (number).
opentracing.jaeger.sampler-param=1
```

## Node.js

We follow cloud native practices for our Node.js services. Please see [Programming with Node.js on IBM Cloud](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/node/index.html#getting-started-tutorial) for more information.

## Access Services in Development

All the services released to production will be packaged up in Helm charts. As this is done, the services will be internalized and only accessible via

`kubectl port-forward svc/<service-name> 8080:80 -n <namespace>`

## Local Service Testing

ISE cloud native microservices are currently protected by a JWT Authorization Token which is injected by the Boomerang Auth Proxy when deployed to a live environment.

When running these service locally this doesn't occur, so you will have to supply this Authorization JWT token yourself.

This can be done by setting the following header

```
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <JWT Token Value Here>
```

Note that this check only occurs when the security.mode is set as following in your application.properties.

```
security.mode=jwt.skip.validate
```

For sample JWT token, reach out to Marcus Roy.

You can make use of [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/) to manipulate this token to change to a different user that resides in the core_users table.
