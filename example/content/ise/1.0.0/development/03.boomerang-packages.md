# Boomerang Packages

We have several npm packages that assist the development of Boomerang webapps. The source code can be found in our [Boomerang Lib](https://github.ibm.com/Boomerang-Lib) GitHub Enterprise organization. They follow the naming convention `boomerang.package.<packageName>` and are published under the `@boomerang` scope.

## Prerequisites

The published packages are hosted on the Boomerang platform Artifactory instance. You must first be [onboarded via Launchpad](https://launch.boomerangplatform.net/launchpad) to the platform with access to Artifactory. Once you have access configure your local client as documented in the section "Setting up your local" in the [frontend onboarding](ise-dev/frontend-developer-onboarding/) docs.

## Boomerang Components

[Boomerang Components](https://github.ibm.com/Boomerang-Lib/boomerang.package.components) is a library of reusable React components built for the Boomerang platform.

- Uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for development and consumption
- Includes fully-custom components and customized wrappers around popular React components
- Published to @boomerang scope and hosted on the Boomerang platform Artifactory instance

### Using

You will need either [npm](https://github.com/npm/npm) or [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn). Either command below will work.

```bash
$ yarn add @boomerang/boomerang-components
```

```bash
$ npm install @boomerang/boomerang-components
```

```js
import LoadingAnimation from "@boomerang/boomerang-components/lib/LoadingAnimation";

<LoadingAnimation />;
```

### Local Development

Often times we want to add, extened or fix a component as it is being used in another application. An easy way to avoid the "change, publish, use" cycle is link the local Boomerang Components repository to your project. Any local changes to the component library will be immediately available to the local project. This speeds up development time and prevents the need to publish several versions of the library to test changes. You can perform a link with both yarn and npm.

- https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/link/
- https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link

### Publishing

You must have your local `~/.npmrc` file set so that the `@boomerang` scope is configured to the Boomerang platform Artifactory instance. Please see the [Frontend Developer Onboarding](/ise-dev/frontend-developer-onboarding/) documentation.

## Boomerang Webapp Server

[Boomerang Webapp Server](https://github.ibm.com/Boomerang-Lib/boomerang.package.webapp-server) provides a consistent way to deploy Boomerang React SPAs with client-side routing into an IBM Cloud Private environment.

### Features

- Serve static assets
- Client-side routing
- Dynamic data and script injection into HTML document at run-time
- Logging with [@boomerang/boomerang-logging-middleware](https://github.ibm.com/Boomerang-Lib/boomerang.middleware.logging)
- Cloud native health checking with [Cloud Native Health Connect](@cloudnative/health-connect)
- New Relic monitoring

### Design

The webapp server can be invoked via a command line or imported as a configurable function to be executed.

- CLI
- Function

### CLI

The server can be invoked easily via a CLI command. Configuration can be entered as options.

Enter the following to see the manual

```shell
boomerang-webapp-server --help
```

Command

```shell
boomerang-webapp-server serve
```

```javascript
const server = require("@boomerang/boomerang-webapp-server");
server({
  cors: {},
  disableInjectHTMLHeadData: true
});
```

### Environment Variables

The following env variables are assumed to exist either from a local `.env` file or passed in to the container at runtime. If nothing is passed it, it will default
