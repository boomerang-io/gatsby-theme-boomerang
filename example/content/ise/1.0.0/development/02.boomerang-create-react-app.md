# Boomerang Create React App

Boomerang Create React App (BCRA) is a fork of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (CRA) with additional configuration and starter template for creating React applications quickly and consistently. It has all of the benefits of the latest starter kit from Facebook with additional features without ejecting. Please reference the CRA project for additional information about using this starter kit beyond what is covered in this document.

The repo can be found on [GitHub Enterprise](https://github.ibm.com/Boomerang/boomerang.app.create-react-app).

## Enhancements

1. [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) and [React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) included
2. Starter template application with hot module reloading, routing and redux configured
3. Boomerang WebApp Server for cloud native deployments via assets path rewriting, client-side routing and dynamic data and script injection.
4. Improved testing with [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) and bundle size analysis with [Source Map Explorer](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer).
5. Boomerang CI and Docker configuration
6. Improved Hot Module Reloading for `JavaScript` files with [React Hot Reloader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
7. Code quality control via [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) and .git commit hooks
8. Included default dependencies for out-of-the-box functionality for network requests, classNames, aysnc redux, routing
9. API server via [JSON-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) for local development and testing
10. Webpack aliases to project top-level directories for clean imports
11. WebWorker support via [Worker-Loder](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/worker-loader)
12. Helper scripts for simulating production deployment, Docker deployment, and upgrading dependencies

## Prereqs

1. Node.js and npm
2. Client configured to use Boomerang Artfifactory npm registry. See [Frontend Developer Onboarding](/ise-dev/frontend-developer-onboarding/) onboarding for further information.

## Create Project with Boomerang Create React App

Run create-react-app command with custom react-scripts flag. This will create a new directory with your React project in it. You will see `boomerang-react-scripts` as a dependency in the `package.json`, along with several defaults.

```shell
$ npx create-react-app <my-project> --scripts-version @boomerang/boomerang-react-scripts
```

## Added Scripts

Projects boostrapped with BCRA will include the default CRA along with the following:

- `analyze` - analyze and debug application's bundle using [source-map-explorer](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer).
- `apiServer` - start API server for local testing using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
- `cm` - commit code using [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) CLI helper.
- `cypress` - start the testing framework [cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress).
- `cypress:run` - run the testing framework [cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) without recording video. Used in CI environment.
- `dev` - start the application and apiServer.
- `docker` - production build, build and run Docker container with [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
- `prod` - production build and start app server locally with [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
- `test` - determine whether to test as if running locally or in a CI system
- `test:ci` - tell jest to run and exit, output coverage report. Used during local development.
- `test:ci-cypress` - start development server and start cypress tests. Used in CI environment.
- `test:coverage` - generate code coverage report,
- `test:staged` - run tests associated with file changes and exit. Used in pre-commit hooks.
- `test:static` - run eslint static code analysis and generate report
- `test:watch` - run Jest in watch mode. Used during local development.
- `upgradePackage` - update application package's dependencies and scripts to match template.

## Upgrading from < v2.2.0

Version `^2.2.0` includes the react-script `upgradePackage` that makes keeping project dependencies and scripts consistent and up to date simple. Upgrading to the newest version however will **not** include the npm script in your project's `package.json` or update your dependencies. Thankfully with versions of `npm@^5.2.0`, the `npx` binary executor is installed by default along with npm. All we need to do is the following:

```sh
npm install @boomerang/boomerang-react-scripts@latest
npx react-scripts upgradePackage
```

You should see the npm script `upgradePackage` added to your `package.json` added along with new or upgraded dependencies. Now keeping things up to date with the latest _app_ configuration changes can be done with `npm run-script upgradePackage`.

## Webpack Aliases

[Webpack aliases](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvealias) make import statements easier to perform and components more portable. They provide a shortcut to specific directories in the `src` of the application. The following aliases are included:

- assets
- components
- config
- constants
- features
- state
- styles
- utilities
- utils

For imports in `.js` files, you can use `from "~Directory"` or `from "Directory"` syntax. Either one works.

```diff
- import { SOME_CONSTANT } from "../../../constants/myConstants";
+ import { SOME_CONSTANT } from "Constants/myConstants";
```

OR

```diff
- import { SOME_CONSTANT } from "../../../constants/myConstants";
+ import { SOME_CONSTANT } from "~Constants/myConstants";
```

For imports in `.scss` files, you must prefix the import with a `~` for Webpack to resolve imports to both our root `styles` directory **AND** to `node_modules`. See [Sass-Loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader#imports) for more information about this.

```diff
- @import "../../../path/to/styles/colors";
+ @import "~Styles/colors"
```

## Testing Config

Additional testing configuration is included by via the `src/setupTests.js` file to simplify unit testing with Jest and Enzyme. It adds:

- Enzyme adapter for React 16 compatibility
- Enzyme functions `shallow`, `render` and `mount` globally available
- Mocked browser storage for `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`
- Fixed UTC date and timezone including config for `moment.js` (useful for snapshots with timestamps)

## Build and Deploy to Kubernetes

We have structured the applications to support cloud native deployment.

- Update app configuration if it is not served on the root context of the host

  - View `"homepage"` property in `package.json`. By default it is set to the following:

  ```json
  "homepage": "https://launch.boomerangplatform.net/BMRG_APP_ROOT_CONTEXT"
  ```

  - Update respective .env files

  ```
  APP_ROOT=/myApp
  ```

* Use dynamic data injected into `<head />` of html file.

  - The environment variables such as `APP_ROOT` must be injected into the container by Kubernetes. Speak to a DevOps team member about any environment variables you need injected into your application.
  - Update web application to read in the global variables added to the `window._SERVER_DATA` object.

  ```js
  // webapp .js file
  const APP_DYNAMIC_CONSTANT = window._SERVER_DATA.APP_DYNAMIC_CONSTANT;
  ```

- Add additional js files to `public` directory and update `HTML_HEAD_INJECTED_SCRIPTS` environment property in corresponding `.env` file - e.g. New Relic analytics
  - You can add multiple files via this property. It accepts a comma separated list of file names. The Boomerang WebApp server will build up the string file to be injected into the `<head />` of the html file automatically.
  ```
  HTML_HEAD_INJECTED_SCRIPTS=newrelic.stage.js,script1.js,script2.js
  ```

## Testing production builds locally

You can test production builds locally to ensure the dynamic data is being injected, the right service endpoints are being called, and the correct scripts are being linked in the index.html file.

Run production build locally. It compiles the application and runs the Express server.

`npm run prod`

Run production build locally in a Docker container. (Assumes user has Docker installed and running locally).

`npm run docker`
