## Configuring Gradle Artifactory access

Create or update your local Gradle gradle.properties with the following properties to store your Artifactory credentials on local machine.

Location of gradle.properties for:

- MacOS/Linux is `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`
- Windows is `c:\Users\[WindowUserName]\.gradle`

```
boomerangLibUser={W3ID Username}
boomerangLibPassword={Artifactory API Token}
```

## Setup gradle build file

In your project build.gradle file, add the repositories groovy snippet to point to Boomerang Lib. The authentication properties that were defined in your settings gradle will be referenced here.

```
 repositories {
     mavenCentral()
      maven {
         url "https://tools.boomerangplatform.net/artifactory/boomeranglib-java"
         credentials {
             username = "$boomerangLibUser"
             password = "$boomerangLibPassword"
         }
     }
 }
```

Once the repositories have been added, you can add additional Boomerang Lib components like you would for regular gradle dependencies.

```
dependencies {
     compile(group: 'net.boomerangplatform', name: 'boomerang-security-spring', version: '0.0.16')
}
```
