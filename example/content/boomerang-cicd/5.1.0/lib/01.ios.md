# iOS Libraries

All custom iOS components that are built/ compiled/tested through the Boomerang CI pipeline can be published to Artifactory for consumption. Artifactory offers a number of benefits over the traditional approach of hosting a Cocoapods including faster pod installs.

## GitHub Mirror

Boomerang Lib also offers a traditional Cocoapods Spec repository hosted on IBM Github Enterprise. This could be useful for mirroring existing frameworks hosted on slower infrastructure or the public internet. The following are notable frameworks that have been mirrored on IBM GitHub Enterprise for faster downloads for developers.

| **Framework** | **Latest Version** |
| :-----------: | :----------------: |
| NewRelicAgent |       6.2.0        |

These can be assumed by adding the following at the top of your Podfile.

```
source 'git@github.ibm.com:Boomerang-Lib/Specs.git'
```

## Artifactory

In order to use CocoaPods with Artifactory, you need the cocoapods-art plugin which presents Artifactory repositories as Specs repos and pod sources.

### Configuring Cocoapod Artifactory access

1.  Install the cocoapods-art plugin:

```
gem install cocoapods-art
```

2.  Setup cocoapods-art authentication credentials in your `.netrc` file placed under `~/`

```
machine tools.boomerangplatform.net
login [INSERT W3 Intranet email address]
password [INSERT Artifactory API Key]
```

3.  Add Artifactory Specs repository

```
pod repo-art add boomeranglib-pod "https://tools.boomerangplatform.net/artifactory/api/pods/boomeranglib-pod"
```

### Downloading Boomerang Lib iOS Dependaices for your application.

1.  Add the following snippet to your application Podfile.

```
plugin 'cocoapods-art', :sources => [
  'boomeranglib-pod'
]
```

2.  Run Pod Install

```
pod install
```

### Creating new Boomerang Lib iOS libraries

To create a new iOS library in BoomernagLib, please use the following pod spec template as a guide on how to configure the s.source value correctly.

This source http url will reference the Podspec name and version dynamically so you can use s.source as is listed here.

```
Pod::Spec.new do |s|

  s.name           = "AKNetworking"
  s.version        = "1.0.1"
  s.summary        = "Network library for iOS"
  s.homepage       = "http://www.ibm.com/mobilefirst/us/en/"

  s.platform       = :ios, "10.0"

  s.author         = { "Marcus Roy" => "mdroy@us.ibm.com" }

  s.source         = { :http => "http://10.150.66.27:8080/artifactory/api/pods/mobilefactory.rml.pod/pod/git/rml/#{s.name}/#{s.version}", type: 'tgz'}

end
```
