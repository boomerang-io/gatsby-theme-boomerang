## Boomerang Lib Versioning

All Boomerang Lib components the following versioning standards must be followed.

Versioning of your component can be automatically handled by Boomerang CI if neded. You can disable this using the `set.version.number=false` property. If this is setting is enabled, Boomerang CI will use the git tag version to override the version set in your framework.

The semantic versioning that needs to be followed for your application is **Major.Minor.Iteration** (i.e., 1.1.0). Versioning follows regular software versioning conventions. Only update one digit based on the changes incurred per release.

**Major versions**
Incrementing the major version will be adding significant features and API changes.

**Minor versions**
Minor versions should be incremented if adding minor features or significant amount of bug fixes. This would normally be the scope of a single release / sprint.

**Iterations versions**
Incrementing the iteration will be bug fixes on the features added to the current minor version.
