# Java mode

The Boomerang CI Java mode will compile a Java archive. It can optionally encapsulate the built artifact into a Docker container image, and store this image in the private, secure Boomerang Docker Registry.

Currently this mode only supports Java 8 languages for Maven and Gradle.

## Boomerang Properties

The following properties can be used with `mode=java` in the `.boomerang.properties` file.

This file needs to be located in the `_boomerang` folder in the root directory of your .git repository.

`.boomerang.properties`:

```
#General
mode=java
build.tool=maven|gradle|docker
build.tool.version=3.5|4.6

#Slack Notifications
notifications.type=slack
notifications.slack.channel=
notifications.slack.dm=

#Filtering
filter.target=tag
filter.expression=^(\d+\.)?(\d+\.)?(\*|\d+)$

#Enable docker packaging
docker.enable=true|false

#Override Tomcat deployment context path set on the environment
deploy.tomcat.path=/your/path
```

### Build Tool

`build.tool=` tells Boomerang CI what type of build script to apply. We currently support the following types:

|  **Build Tool**   | **Support** |                                                                **Useful For**                                                                |
| :---------------: | :---------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| build.tool=maven  |    full     |   Currently defines the use of Maven when compiling a Java microservice. A `mvn package` command will be run to compile the Java project.    |
| build.tool=gradle |    full     | Currently defines the use of Gradle when compiling a Java microservice. A `gradle assemble` command will be run to compile the Java project. |
| build.tool=docker |    full     |  Currently defines the use of Docker when compiling a Java microservice. A `docker build` command will be run to compile the Java project.   |

## Prerequisites

### Build Tool Files

The required files for the respective build tools are required to be in the root directory.

- _Maven:_ `pom.xml`
- _Gradle:_ `build.gradle`
- _Docker:_ `Dockerfile`

### Docker requirements

If you have set `build.tool=docker` or `docker.enable=true`, a `Dockerfile` is required to be present in the root directory of the repository for the build to be successful.

## Docker

We currently support the following with Docker

- encapsulating a Maven or Gradle compiled artifact in a Docker container image
- build a provided `Dockerfile` that compiles an artifact and encapsulates it in Docker container image

### Container Image

If you want to produce a Docker container that encapsulates a built artifact you need to include a `Dockerfile`. Please use the following example:

```
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine
VOLUME /tmp
EXPOSE 8080
ADD target/service.jar
RUN sh -c 'touch /service.jar'
ENV JAVA_OPTS=""
ENTRYPOINT [ "sh", "-c", "java $JAVA_OPTS -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -jar /service.jar" ]
```

### Artifact Compilation and Image build

As noted above, we only support Java 8 for Maven and Gradle. If your project needs another version of Java, we allow you to perform the compilation step in your Dockerfile via the `build.tool=docker` property. The CI system requires the following to be performed by the Dockerfile:

- compile the asset
- encapsulate that asset in the container image like in the previous section.

We recommend performing a [multi-stage build](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) in your Dockerfile to reduce the image size. Performing the build manually requires the following commands to be in your Dockerfile, depending on what build tool you use. Our CI system uses to inject required properties for the build to work in our environnments.

The following build args will be provided to your Dockerfile using the `--build-arg` flag:

| **Buil Tool** |      **Value**      |
| :-----------: | :-----------------: |
|     Maven     | `ENV MAVEN_OPTS=""` |
|      Ant      |  `ENV ANT_OPTS=""`  |

The following build args will be provided to your Dockerfile using the `--build-arg` flag:

| **Arg**  | **Value**  | **Example** |
| :------: | :--------: | :---------: |
| BMRG_TAG | \<git tag> |    1.2.1    |

The following is a complete `Dockerfile` for a Maven build:

```
FROM maven:3.6.0-jdk-12-alpine
ENV MAVEN_OPTS=""
ARG BMRG_TAG
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dversion.name=$BMRG_TAG

FROM openjdk:12-jdk-alpine
COPY --from=0 /app/target/*.jar ./
ARG BMRG_TAG
VOLUME /tmp
EXPOSE 7717
RUN mv service-lib-$BMRG_TAG.jar service.jar
RUN sh -c 'touch /service.jar'
ENV JAVA_OPTS=""
ENTRYPOINT [ "sh", "-c", "java $JAVA_OPTS -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -jar /service.jar" ]
```

## Constraints

### Docker Port

For the out-of-the-box Boomerang CI Docker pipeline, there are constraints on the exposed ports for the service. The port is `8080`
