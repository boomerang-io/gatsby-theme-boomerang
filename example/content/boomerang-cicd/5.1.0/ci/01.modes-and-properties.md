# Modes and Properties

Everything in Boomerang CI is driven by the mode and customized or extended by the `.boomerang.properties` file

Every repository that is connected to Boomerang CI will need to include a `.boomerang.properties` file. This file needs to be located in the `_boomerang` folder in the root directory of your git repository.

The required configuration is very minimalistic and the following summarizes the properties required and in what mode.

## Modes

Modes tell Boomerang CI what to do and allows you as the user to run activities in slightly different ways. It allows for speific functionality to be enabled based on the underlying technology and denotes the infrastructure where we will create, run, and terminate the distributed workers. The following table summarizes the modes available to you.

## Filtering

By default, Boomerang CI will perform a new activity for every git push to your repository once it's been connected with your chosen repository.

This includes all branches being worked on in your repository such as: master, develop, and feature branches.

You can provide custom behavior by modifying your '.boomerang.properties' with the following filter properties

```
filter.target=tag/branch/all
filter.expression=^(\d+\.)?(\d+\.)?(\*|\d+)$
```

Here is an example of triggering from every git push on your release branch.

```
filter.target=branch
filter.expression=^release$
```

Here is a case of triggering from every git tag received in the format of 1.0.0

```
filter.target=tag
filter.expression=^(\d+\.)?(\d+\.)?(\*|\d+)$
```

Here is a case of triggering from every push event (tag and branch) but filtered by either the developer and master branches, OR any tag in the format of 1.0.0

```
filter.target=all
filter.expression=^((develop|master)|(\d+\.)?(\d+\.)?(\*|\d+))$
```

## Pipelines

CI supports targetting a specific pipeline. This can be enabled by specifying the following properties in your '.boomerang.properties' file.

The pipeline name is used and can be found from your pipelines tab. Case is ignored.

```
pipeline.target=pipeline name
```

## Legacy Properties

```
#Name of Product. Used throughout automation as a naming standard.
name=Product Name/Adapter name

#Identifier for the CI team
team.name=CI Team Identifier

#Replaced by notifications.slack.enable=true|false
notifications.type=slack

#Pipeline filtering. The filtering properties will need to be prefixed with `pipeline.<pipeline_name>.`, where `<pipeline_name>` is the name of the pipeline visible in CI.
pipeline.type=multi
pipeline.upgrade.filter.target=tag
pipeline.upgrade.filter.expression=^(\d+\.)?(\d+\.)?(\*|\d+)-upgrade(\.\d+)?$
```
