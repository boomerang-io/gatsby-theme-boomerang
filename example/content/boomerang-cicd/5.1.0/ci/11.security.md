# Security

There are multiple aspects to the security implementation in CI

## Workers

Every worker is a self contained short living execution runner. All source code, artifacts, keys, and secure values are only pulled into the worker as it is executing. The worker is then removed upon completion.

## Docker Image building

Under the covers we use `img` which is more secure and runs unpriviledged, in comparison to other methods such as Docker in Docker. Docker in docker exposes the host to the worker.

## Certificates

For mobile CI, certificates are required to sign the mobile applications. These certificates can be uploaded by the user, securely over HTTPS as an encrypted key store and stored in a secure artifact repository controlled by RBAC. The password to the certificate is stored separately and is hashed by SHA256 and is unretrievable once forgotten.
