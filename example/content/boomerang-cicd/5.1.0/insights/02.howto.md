# Implementing New Relic in your tools

The following information will help in implementing new relic in your GBS Tool.

## Need access to new relic

If you need access to new relic, navigate to [Boomerang Launchpad](https://launch.boomerangplatform.net) and request a new team request with New Relic as the tool.

## Add New Relic to a Browser Tool

Read and understand the [New Relic Browser documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/install-new-relic-browser-agent) to understand how to install. A number of the tools go the route of Copy / Paste Javascript

## Browser User Tracking

For the Browser tools, we need to track number of users so its important to set the User ID after login and then send a page action to new relic. Sample code is as follows;

```
// Set custom attribute in newrelic agent for user page action tracking
// https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/set-custom-attribute
newrelic.setCustomAttribute('userId', currentUserId);


// send custom page action to newrelic with json object
// https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/add-page-action
newrelic.addPageAction(actionName, jsonObject);
```
