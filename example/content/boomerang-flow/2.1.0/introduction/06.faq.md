# Frequently Asked Questions

## How long does a workflow take to execute?

A workflow can take any amount of time. A workflow will generally start executing a task within 3 seconds and a simple workflow with a single task will usually take less then 15 seconds end to end.

## Does enabling the workflow option for persistent storage have a performance impact?

When enabling the workflow option for persistent storage this will have a small performance impact as the system works behind the scenes to spin up storage prior to executing any tasks on the workflow.

In tests this has taken from `5 - 10 seconds` of additional time.

## Are there any time limits defined or that can be set?

We do not yet have customizable limits or timeouts implemented in flow.

## Can I create my own custom tasks

Yes. You can bring your own containers and run them through the use of the Custom Task in the pallette.
