# Getting started

Boomerang Flow integrates with your Boomerang teams. Ensure you have access to a team or create a new team and request access to Boomerang Flow.

Once you have access, you can open from Launchpad and start creating new workflows straight away.

## Need Help?

Anywhere from within the app, you can select the `?` in the top right hand corner to enable contextual help.

## Optimal Browser Support

Flow is optimized from Chrome. We have implemented an optimal browser support modal for all other browsers.
