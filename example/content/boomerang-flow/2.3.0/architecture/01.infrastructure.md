# Infrastructure Architecture

The CICD infrastructure is based on top of the platforms base infrastructure architecture [found here](/boomerang/7.0.0/architecture/infrastructure)

In addition to this, CICD also has some additionnal areas to be aware of.

## Kubernetes Workers

The Flow Task Workers run as Kubernetes Jobs with Configmaps, Secrets, and Persistent Volumes.

### Ephemeral Storage

As with all containers there is ephemeral storage used, which we have limited to 8GB by default. This impacts that number of workers that can be running in parallel based on the amount of primary disk used so is important. 

Flow workers have a setting to delete completed workers, if this is not enabled, then the completed workers will stick around and use up the available ephemeral storage.

See [Kubernetes ephemeral storage](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/#local-ephemeral-storage) reference information.

### Persistent Volumes

If the workflow storage is enabled for a component, then this will create and keep the persistent volume during workflow execution. These are set at 1GB.

This can cause quite a churn of persistent volumes.
