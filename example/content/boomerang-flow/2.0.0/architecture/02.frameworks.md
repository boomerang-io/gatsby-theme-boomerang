# Framework Architecture

Flow mainly focuses on providing no to low code pre built tasks. However if you want to build your own you can use the Node CLI framework which comes with a number of pre-built functions.

## Node CLI

Provides a base docker image with node and file system structures to wrap Node.js written tasks. Once imported all you need to is drop a file or script into specific folders to be imported and available

- A CLI wrapper and execution model
- Helper log methods
- Helper Property methods - handles properties and property layering from Flows model
